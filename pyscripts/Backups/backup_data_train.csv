== Subspecies ==

As treated here, there are two subspecies; these are also variously treated at either the lower rank of variety by some authors, or as distinct species by others:


=== Abies concolor subsp"
Abies concolor," concolor ===
Abies concolor subsp"
Abies concolor, concolor — Colorado white fir or Rocky Mountains white fir
Abies concolor," In the United States, at altitudes of 1,700–3,400 m (5,600–11,200 ft) in the Rocky Mountains from southern Idaho, south through Utah and Colorado, to New Mexico and Arizona, and on the higher Great Basin mountains of Nevada and extreme southeastern California, and a short distance into northern Sonora, Mexico"
Abies concolor," A smaller tree to 25–35 m (80–115 ft) tall, rarely 45 m (150 ft)"
Abies concolor, Foliage strongly upcurved to erect on all except weak shaded shoots in the lower crown; leaves mostly 3
Abies concolor,"5–6 cm (1 3⁄8–2 3⁄8 in), and strongly glaucous on the upper side with numerous stomata"
Abies concolor, Tolerates winter temperatures down to about −40 °C (−40 °F)
Abies concolor,"


=== Abies concolor subsp"
Abies concolor," lowiana ===
Abies concolor subsp"
Abies concolor, lowiana (syn
Abies concolor, Abies lowiana) — Low's white fir or Sierra Nevada white fir
Abies concolor," In the United States, at altitudes of 900–2,300 m (3,000–7,500 ft)  from the Cascades of central Oregon south through California (Klamath Mountains, Sierra Nevada) to northern Baja California, Mexico"
Abies concolor, A larger tree to 40–60 m (130–195 ft) tall
Abies concolor," Foliage flattened on lower crown shoots, the leaves often raised above the shoot on upper crown shoots but not often strongly upcurved; leaves mostly 2"
Abies concolor,"5–5 cm (1–2 in), and only weakly glaucous on the upper side with few or no stomata"
Abies concolor, Tolerates winter temperatures down to about −30 °C (−22 °F)
Abies concolor, The United States Department of Agriculture plants database describes this subspecies as the full species Sierra white fir - Abies lowiana (Gordon & Glend
Abies concolor,) A
Abies concolor, Murray bis
Abies concolor,"


=== Related species ===
White fir is very closely related to grand fir (Abies grandis), with subspecies lowiana being particularly similar to the interior variety of grand fir A"
Abies concolor, grandis var
Abies concolor," idahoensis, intergrading with it where they meet in the Cascades of central Oregon"
Abies concolor," To the south in Mexico, it is replaced by further close relatives, Durango fir (A"
Abies concolor, durangensis) and Mexican fir (A
Abies concolor, mexicana)
Abies concolor,"


== Forest succession ==
White fir is a shade tolerant, climax species, which means the forest has reached complex maturity in forest succession in western coniferous forests of the United States"
Abies concolor, White fir and yellow pine (ponderosa pine/Jeffrey pine) have co-existed for millennia in old growth forests throughout their range
Abies concolor," In the presence of logging of large diameter trees and exclusion of cleansing wildfires, young trees have become abundant over the past two centuries"
Abies concolor," White fir had been regarded as a pest in the past by those in the lumber industry, but this opinion has changed"
Abies concolor, White fir is now one of the most important of all commercial softwoods according to the Western Wood Products Association
Abies concolor,The white fir trait of retaining lower limbs creates an escape route for medium to small forest birds (spotted owl) from larger flying predators and provides a drip zone around the roots for collecting moisture
Abies concolor, The retained limbs can become a fire ladder that allow flames to climb up to the canopy
Abies concolor," Limbing-up white fir, instead of removing medium to large diameter trees, in areas where the public is more likely to start fires can help keep other trees and specifically giant sequoia from experiencing canopy fire"
Abies concolor, Recent concern for sequoia groves has caused agencies to call for removal of white fir in the Sierra Nevada
Abies concolor," While sequoia seedlings and young saplings are highly susceptible to mortality or serious injury by fire; mature sequoias are fire adapted with: fire resistant bark, elevated canopies, self-pruning lower branches, latent buds, and serotinous cones"
Abies concolor, The sequoia ecosystem is incomplete without the mixed pine/fir and oak that make up the mid and understory
Abies concolor, Giant Sequoia's cones release seeds when the heat of fire triggers them to open while the thick bark protects the inner cambium from fire damage
Abies concolor,"

=== Dependent species ===
Mature white fir–yellow pine forests support old-growth dependent wildlife species such as California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis), Mount Pinos sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus howardi), and Pacific fisher (Pekania pennanti)"
Abies concolor, The spotted owl and fisher utilize cavities in decadent large diameter white fir for nesting and denning
Abies concolor, The Mount Pinos sooty grouse requires large diameter trees for thermal cover and its winter diet consists of mostly white fir and yellow pine needles
Abies concolor, This subspecies of sooty grouse has been extirpated along with a significant number of large diameter white fir from much of its range
Abies concolor," Other subspecies of sooty grouse also utilize Douglas fir, which does not occur in the range of Mount Pinos sooty grouse"
Abies concolor, Squirrel also frequent the tree's branches
Abies concolor,Deer browse the foliage of this species and porcupines chew the bark
Abies concolor," Songbirds, grouse, and various mammals eat the seeds"
Abies concolor,"


== Uses ==

Acer platanoides," On mature trees, sugar maple bark is more shaggy, while Norway maple bark has small, often criss-crossing grooves"
Acer platanoides," While the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all maple species, the leaf lobes of Norway maple tend to have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on sugar maples"
Acer platanoides," Flowering and seed production begins at ten years of age, however large quantities of seeds are not produced until the tree is 20"
Acer platanoides," As with most maples, Norway maple is normally dioecious (separate male and female trees), occasionally monoecious, and trees may change gender from year to year"

Acer platanoides, Leaf drop in autumn is triggered when day length falls to ten hours and 30 minutes
Acer platanoides," Depending on the latitude, leaf drop may vary by as much as three weeks, beginning in the first week of October in Scandinavia and at month's end in southern Europe"
Acer platanoides," Unlike some other maples that wait for the soil to warm up, A"
Acer platanoides," platanoides seeds require only three months of exposure to temperatures lower than 4 °C (40 °F) and will sprout in early spring, around the same time that leafout begins"
Acer platanoides," Norway maple does not require freezing temperatures for proper growth, however it is adapted to higher latitudes with long summer days and does not perform well when planted south of the 37th parallel, the approximate southern limit of its range in Europe"

Acer pseudoplatanus," Its natural range includes Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, southern Russia, Spain, Switzerland and the former Yugoslavia"
Acer pseudoplatanus, Reports of it occurring in eastern Turkey have been found to refer to A
Acer pseudoplatanus, heldreichii subsp
Acer pseudoplatanus, trautvetteri
Acer pseudoplatanus,"
It was probably introduced into Britain in the Tudor period by 1500 and was first recorded in the wild in 1632 in Kent"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The date of its first introduction into Ireland is unclear, but the oldest specimen in Ireland is in County Cavan and dates from the seventeenth century"
Acer pseudoplatanus, It was introduced into Sweden around 1770 with seeds obtained from Holland
Acer pseudoplatanus,"The lack of old native names for it has been used to demonstrate its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least as far back as the Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries"
Acer pseudoplatanus, This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention
Acer pseudoplatanus," At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte, a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500"
Acer pseudoplatanus," Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"The sycamore has been introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park, street or garden"
Acer pseudoplatanus," These include the United States, Canada, Australia (Victoria and Tasmania), Chile and New Zealand, Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores"
Acer pseudoplatanus, At the time of its introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds might one day cause a problem to the landscape as it spread and out-competed native species
Acer pseudoplatanus," The tree is now considered to be an environmental weed in some parts of Australia (Yarra Ranges, Victoria) and also Mount Macedon, near Daylesford, parts of the Dandenong Ranges, where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The sycamore is also scattered in north-eastern Tasmania and also at Taroona, near the Derwent River, in southern Hobart"
Acer pseudoplatanus," It is considered to be an invasive species in New Zealand, Norway, and environmentally sensitive locations in the United Kingdom"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"In about 1870, the sycamore was introduced into the United States, and was planted in New York and New Jersey"
Acer pseudoplatanus, It was later cultivated as a park or street tree in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states
Acer pseudoplatanus," By the early part of the 21st century, it was naturalised in fourteen states (Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington, D"

== Ecology ==

In its native range, the sycamore is a natural component of birch (Betula sp"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"), beech (Fagus sp"
Acer pseudoplatanus,) and fir (Abies sp
Acer pseudoplatanus,) forests
Acer pseudoplatanus,"  It readily invades disturbed habitats such as forest plantations, abandoned farmland and brownfield land, railway lines and roadsides verges, hedgerows, native and semi-natural woodland and, in New Zealand,  high country tussock grassland"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"  As an introduced, invasive species it may degrade the laurel forest in Madeira and Portugal and is a potential threat to the rare endemic Madeiran orchid, Dactylorhiza foliosa"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"It is tolerant of a wide range of soil types and pH, except heavy clay, and is at its best on nutrient-rich slightly calcareous soils"
Acer pseudoplatanus,  The roots of the sycamore form highly specific beneficial mycorrhizal associations with the fungus Glomus hoi which promotes phosphorus uptake from the soil
Acer pseudoplatanus," Sycamore mycorrhizas are of the internal arbuscular mycorrhizal type, in which the fungus grows within the tissues of the root and forms branched, tree-like structures within the cells of the root cortex"
Acer pseudoplatanus,The larvae of a number of species of moth use the leaves as a food source
Acer pseudoplatanus," These include the sycamore moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera)"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds"
Acer pseudoplatanus," As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"The tree may also be attacked by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from the trunk and branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree"
Acer pseudoplatanus," Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"The sycamore gall mite Eriophyes macrorhynchus produces small red galls, similar to those of the nail gall mite Eriophyes tiliae, on leaves of sycamore and field maple, Acer campestris from April onwards"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"  Another mite, Aceria pseudoplatani causes a 'sycamore felt gall' on the underside of leaves of both sycamore and Norway maple (Acer platanoides)"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The sycamore aphid Drepanosiphum platanoidis sucks sap from buds and foliage, producing large quantities of sticky honeydew that contaminate foliage, cars and garden furniture beneath"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"The sycamore is susceptible to sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale"
Acer pseudoplatanus, This causes wilting of the crown and the death of branches
Acer pseudoplatanus, Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores
Acer pseudoplatanus," The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis"
Acer pseudoplatanus," Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage"
Acer pseudoplatanus, The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected
Acer pseudoplatanus," Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall"
Acer pseudoplatanus, This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run

== Cultivation ==

Sycamore self-seeds very vigorously, the seeds germinating en masse in the spring so that there is little, or no, seed bank in the soil"
Acer pseudoplatanus," It is readily propagated from seed in cultivation, but varieties cannot be relied on to breed true"
Acer pseudoplatanus,  Special cultivars such A
Acer pseudoplatanus, pseudoplatanus 'Brilliantissimum' may be propagated by grafting

Acer pseudoplatanus,"The sycamore is noted for its tolerance of wind, urban pollution, salt spray, and low summer temperatures, which makes it a popular tree for planting in cities, along roads treated with salt in winter, and in coastal localities"
Acer pseudoplatanus," It is cultivated and widely naturalised north of its native range in Northern Europe, notably in the British Isles and Scandinavia north to Tromsø, Norway (seeds can ripen as far north as Vesterålen); Reykjavík, Iceland; and Tórshavn on the Faroe Islands"
Acer pseudoplatanus," It now occurs throughout the British Isles, having been introduced in the 16th century"
Acer pseudoplatanus,Sycamores make new growth from the stump or roots if cut down and can therefore be coppiced to produce poles and other types of small timber
Acer pseudoplatanus," Its coppice stools grow comparatively rapidly, reaching up to 10 feet (3"
Acer pseudoplatanus,0 m) in diameter in 450 years
Acer pseudoplatanus, It is grown as a species for medium to large bonsai in many areas of Europe where some fine specimens can be found
Acer pseudoplatanus,"


== Uses ==
Sycamore is planted in parks for ornamental purposes, and sometimes as  a street tree, since its tolerance of air pollution makes it suitable for use in urban plantings"
Acer pseudoplatanus," Because of its tolerance to wind, it has often been planted in coastal and exposed areas as a windbreak"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"It produces a hard-wearing, white or cream close-grained timber that turns golden with age"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The wood can be worked and sawn in any direction and is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and parquetry"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"  Because it is non-staining, is used for kitchen utensils, wooden spoons, bowls, rolling pins and chopping boards"
Acer pseudoplatanus," In Scotland it has traditionally been used for making fine boxes, sometimes in association with contrasting, dark-coloured laburnum wood"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"Occasionally, trees produce wood with a wavy grain, greatly increasing the value for decorative veneers"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630 kg per cubic metre"
Acer pseudoplatanus," It is a traditional wood for use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins"
Acer pseudoplatanus, The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore
Acer pseudoplatanus," Whistles can be made from straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall"
Acer pseudoplatanus," The wood is used for fuel, being easy to saw and to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"In Scotland, sycamores were once a favoured tree for hangings, because their lower branches rarely broke under the strain"
Acer pseudoplatanus," Both male and female flowers produce abundant nectar, which makes a fragrant, delicately flavoured and pale-coloured honey"
Acer pseudoplatanus, The nectar and copious dull yellow ochre pollen are collected by honeybees as food sources
Acer pseudoplatanus,"  The sap rises vigorously in the spring and like that of sugar maple can be tapped to provide a refreshing drink, as a source of sugar and to make syrup or beer"
Acer pseudoplatanus,"

Acer rubrum,"  By removing red maple from a young forest recovering from disturbance, the natural cycle of forest regeneration is altered, changing the diversity of the forest for centuries to come"
Acer rubrum,"


== Description ==

Though A"
Acer rubrum," rubrum is usually easy to identify, it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics"
Acer rubrum," It is a medium to large sized tree, reaching heights of 27 to 38 metres (90 to 120 ft) and exceptionally over 41 metres (135 feet) in the southern Appalachians where conditions favor its growth"
Acer rubrum, The leaves are usually 9 to 11 centimetres (3 1⁄2 to 4 1⁄4 in) long on a full-grown tree
Acer rubrum," The trunk diameter often ranges from 46 to 88 cm (18 to 35 in); depending on the growing conditions, however, open grown trees can attain diameters of up to 153 centimetres (60 in)"
Acer rubrum," The trunk will remain free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees, while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown"
Acer rubrum, Trees on poorer sites often become malformed and scraggly
Acer rubrum, Generally the crown is irregularly ovoid with ascending whip-like curved shoots
Acer rubrum, The bark is a pale grey and smooth when the individual is young
Acer rubrum, As the tree grows the bark becomes darker and cracks into slightly raised long plates
Acer rubrum," The largest known living red maple is located near Armada, Michigan, at a height of 38"
Acer rubrum,"1 m (125 ft) and a bole circumference, at breast height, of 4"
Acer rubrum,95 m (16 ft 3 in)
Acer rubrum,"

The leaves of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives"
Acer rubrum," As with all North American maple trees, they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig"
Acer rubrum, They are typically 5–10 cm (2–4 in) long and wide with 3-5 palmate lobes with a serrated margin
Acer rubrum," The sinuses are typically narrow, but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation"
Acer rubrum," When five lobes are present, the three at the terminal end are larger than the other two near the base"
Acer rubrum," In contrast, the leaves of the related silver maple, A"
Acer rubrum," saccharinum, are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes"
Acer rubrum, The upper side of A
Acer rubrum, rubrum's leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either glaucous or hairy
Acer rubrum, The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to 10 cm (4 in) long
Acer rubrum," The leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals"
Acer rubrum, Soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red
Acer rubrum, The fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler
Acer rubrum,"

The twigs of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small lenticels"
Acer rubrum, Dwarf shoots are present on many branches
Acer rubrum," The buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales"
Acer rubrum," The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well"
Acer rubrum, The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint
Acer rubrum, The leaf scars on the twig are V-shaped and contain 3 bundle scars
Acer rubrum,"

The flowers are generally unisexual, with male and female flowers appearing in separate sessile clusters, though they are sometimes also bisexual"
Acer rubrum," They appear in late winter to early spring, from December to May depending on elevation and latitude, usually before the leaves"
Acer rubrum," The tree itself is considered polygamodioecious, meaning some individuals are male, some female, and some monoecious"
Acer rubrum," Under the proper conditions, the tree can sometimes switch from male to female, male to hermaphroditic, and hermaphroditic to female"
Acer rubrum,"  The red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old, but it significantly varies between tree to tree: some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old"
Acer rubrum," The flowers are red with 5 small petals and a 5-lobed calyx, usually at the twig tips"
Acer rubrum, The staminate flowers are sessile
Acer rubrum," The pistillate flowers are borne on pedicels that grow out while the flowers are blooming, so that eventually the flowers are in a hanging cluster with stems 1 to 5 cm (1⁄2 to 2 in) long"
Acer rubrum, The petals are lineal to oblong in shape and are pubescent
Acer rubrum, The pistillate flowers have one pistil formed from two fused carpels with a glabrous superior ovary and two long styles that protrude beyond the perianth
Acer rubrum," The staminate flowers contain between 4 and 12 stamens, often with 8"
Acer rubrum,The fruit is a samara 15 to 25 millimeters (5⁄8 to 1 in) long that grows in pairs with somewhat divergent wings at an angle of 50 to 60 degrees

Acer rubrum," They ripen from April through early June, before even the leaf development is altogether complete"
Acer rubrum," After they reach maturity, the seeds are dispersed for a 1 to 2 week period from April through July"
Acer rubrum,"


== Distribution and habitat ==
A"
Acer rubrum, rubrum is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern North America
Acer rubrum," It can be found from the south of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and southern Quebec to the south west of Ontario, extreme southeastern Manitoba and northern Minnesota; south to Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, eastern Oklahoma, and eastern Texas in its western range; and east to Florida"
Acer rubrum, It has the largest continuous range along the North American Atlantic Coast of any tree that occurs in Florida
Acer rubrum," In total it ranges 2,600 km (1,600 mi) from north to south"
Acer rubrum, The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the 95th meridian
Acer rubrum," The tree's range ends where the −40 °C (−40 °F) mean minimum isotherm begins, namely in southeastern Canada"
Acer rubrum, A
Acer rubrum," rubrum is not present in the Prairie Peninsula of the northern Midwest, the coastal prairie in southern Louisiana and southeastern Texas and the swamp prairie of the Florida Everglades"
Acer rubrum, Red maple's western range stops with the Great Plains where conditions become too dry for it
Acer rubrum, The absence of red maple from the Prairie Peninsula is most likely due to the tree's poor tolerance of wildfires
Acer rubrum," Red maple is most abundant in the Northeastern US, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and northeastern Wisconsin and is rare in the extreme west of its range and in the Southeastern US"
Acer rubrum,"In several other locations, the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats"
Acer rubrum," An example is the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains, but is present along streams"
Acer rubrum," Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt, despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area"
Acer rubrum," In the Northeastern US, red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations, but will eventually give way to sugar maple"
Acer rubrum,A
Acer rubrum," rubrum does very well in a wide range of soil types, with varying textures, moisture, pH, and elevation, probably more so than any other forest tree in North America"
Acer rubrum, A
Acer rubrum," rubrum's high pH tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places, and it  is widespread along the eastern United States"
Acer rubrum," It grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from the following rocks: granite, gneiss, schist, sandstone, shale, slate, conglomerate, quartzite, and limestone"
Acer rubrum," Chlorosis can occur on very alkaline soils, though otherwise its pH tolerance is quite high"
Acer rubrum, Moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds
Acer rubrum,"Red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps"
Acer rubrum," While many types of tree prefer a south- or north-facing aspect, the red maple does not appear to have a preference"
Acer rubrum," Its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations"
Acer rubrum," However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes"
Acer rubrum," Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions"
Acer rubrum," In northern Michigan and New England, the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps"
Acer rubrum," In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps"
Acer rubrum," Additionally, red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas"
Acer rubrum,Red maple is far more abundant today than when Europeans first arrived in North America
Acer rubrum," It only contributed minimally to old growth upland forests, and would only form same-species stands in riparian zones"
Acer rubrum," The density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6- to 7-fold, and this trend seems to be continuing, all of which is due to human factors, mainly continued heavy logging and a recent trend of young, shrubby forests recovering from past human disturbances"
Acer rubrum," Also, the decline of American elm and American chestnut due to introduced diseases has contributed to its spread"
Acer rubrum," Red maple dominates such sites, but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature"
Acer rubrum, This species is in fact a vital part of forest regeneration in the same way that paper birch is
Acer rubrum,"Because it can grow on a variety of substrates, has a high pH tolerance, and grows in both shade and sun, A"
Acer rubrum," rubrum is a prolific seed producer and highly adaptable, often dominating disturbed sites"
Acer rubrum,"  While many believe that it is replacing historically dominant tree species in the eastern United States such as sugar maples, beeches, oaks, hemlocks and pines, red maple will only dominate young forests prone to natural or human disturbance"
Acer rubrum,"  In areas disturbed by humans where the species thrives, it can reduce diversity, but in a mature forest it is not a dominant species; it only has a sparse presence and adds to the diversity and ecological structure of a forest"
Acer rubrum, Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate
Acer rubrum," Finally, disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the US"
Acer rubrum," While mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil, more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple"
Acer rubrum,"


== Ecology ==
Red maple's maximum lifespan is 150 years, but most live less than 100 years"
Acer rubrum," The tree's thin bark is easily damaged from ice and storms, animals, and when used in landscaping, being struck by flying debris from lawn mowers, allowing fungi to penetrate and cause heart rot"
Acer rubrum,Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce roots to suit its site from a young age
Acer rubrum," In wet locations, red maple seedlings produce short taproots with long, well-developed lateral roots; while on dry sites, they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals"
Acer rubrum," The roots are primarily horizontal, however, forming in the upper 25 cm (9"
Acer rubrum,8 in) of the ground
Acer rubrum, Mature trees have woody roots up to 25 m (82 ft) long
Acer rubrum," They are very tolerant of flooding, with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage"
Acer rubrum," At the same time, they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve, even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks"
Acer rubrum,"

A"
Acer rubrum, rubrum is one of the first plants to flower in spring
Acer rubrum, A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year
Acer rubrum, A single tree between 5 and 20 cm (2
Acer rubrum,0 and 7
Acer rubrum,"9 in) in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season"
Acer rubrum, A tree 30 cm (0
Acer rubrum,98 ft) in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds
Acer rubrum, Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples
Acer rubrum,  Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application
Acer rubrum,"
The seeds are epigeal and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present"
Acer rubrum," If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring"
Acer rubrum, Most seedlings do not survive in closed forest canopy situations
Acer rubrum," However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy"
Acer rubrum," Though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above"
Acer rubrum,"
Trees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, for instance to Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples"
Acer rubrum," Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences"
Acer rubrum,"

Red maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire"
Acer rubrum, One study found that 6 years after clearcutting a 3
Acer rubrum,4 hectares (8
Acer rubrum,"4 acres) Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than 1"
Acer rubrum,4 m (4
Acer rubrum,6 ft)
Acer rubrum," One of its associates, the black cherry (Prunus serotina), contains benzoic acid, which has been shown to be a potential allelopathic inhibitor of red maple growth"
Acer rubrum, Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation

Acer saccharum,"


== Ecology ==

The sugar maple is an extremely important species to the ecology of many forests in the northern United States and Canada"
Acer saccharum," Pure stands are common, and it is a major component of the northern and Midwestern U"
Acer saccharum,S
Acer saccharum, hardwood forests
Acer saccharum," Due to its need for cold winters, sugar maple is mostly found north of the 40th parallel in USDA growing zones 3-5"
Acer saccharum, It is less common in the southern part of its range (USDA Zone 6) where summers are hot and humid; there sugar maple is confined to ravines and moist flatlands
Acer saccharum," In the east, from Maryland southward, it is limited to the Appalachians"
Acer saccharum," In the west, Tennessee represents the southern limit of its range"
Acer saccharum, Collection of sap for sugar is also not possible in the southern part of sugar maple's range as winter temperatures do not become cold enough
Acer saccharum,"
The minimum seed-bearing age of sugar maple is about 200 years"
Acer saccharum," The tree is long-lived, typically 200 years and occasionally as much as 300"
Acer saccharum,"
Sugar maple is native to areas with cooler climates and requires a hard freeze each winter for proper dormancy"
Acer saccharum," In northern parts of its range, January temperatures average about −18 °C (0 °F) and July temperatures about 16 °C (61 °F); in southern parts, January temperatures average about 10 °C (50 °F) and July temperatures average almost 27 °C (81 °F)"
Acer saccharum,"Seed germination also requires extremely low temperatures, the optimal being just slightly above freezing, and no other known tree species has this property"
Acer saccharum, Germination of sugar maple seed in temperatures above 50 °F (10 °C) is rare to nonexistent
Acer saccharum,"
Acer saccharum is among the most shade tolerant of large deciduous trees"
Acer saccharum," Its shade tolerance is exceeded only by the striped maple, a smaller tree"
Acer saccharum," Like other maples, its shade tolerance is manifested in its ability to germinate and persist under a closed canopy as an understory plant, and respond with rapid growth to the increased light formed by a gap in the canopy"
Acer saccharum," Sugar maple can tolerate virtually any soil type short of pure sand, but does not tolerate xeric or swampy conditions"
Acer saccharum,"
Sugar maples are deeper-rooted than most maples and engage in hydraulic lift, drawing water from lower soil layers and exuding that water into upper, drier soil layers"
Acer saccharum," This not only benefits the tree itself, but also many other plants growing around it"
Acer saccharum,"

Human influences have contributed to the decline of the sugar maple in many regions"
Acer saccharum, Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more opportunistic species in areas where forests are cut over
Acer saccharum," Climate change has contributed to the decline of the sugar maple by pushing the suitable habitat range for the trees further north, where temperatures are cooler"
Acer saccharum, This has resulted in a gradual northward migration of the species
Acer saccharum, The sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple
Acer saccharum, Acid rain and soil acidification are some of the primary contributing factors to maple decline
Acer saccharum," Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads for deicing purposes has decimated the sugar maple's role as a street tree"
Acer saccharum, The mushroom Pholiota squarrosoides is known to decay the logs of the tree
Acer saccharum,"In some parts of New England, particularly near urbanized areas, the sugar maple is being displaced by the Norway maple"
Acer saccharum," The Norway maple is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions, resulting in the sugar maple's replacement in those areas"
Acer saccharum," In addition, Norway maple produces much larger crops of seeds, allowing it to out-compete native species"
Acer saccharum,"


== Cultivation and uses ==


=== Maple syrup ===

The sugar maple is one of the most important Canadian trees, being, with the black maple, the major source of sap for making maple syrup"
Acer saccharum," Other maple species can be used as a sap source for maple syrup, but some have lower sugar contents and/or produce more cloudy syrup than these two"
Acer saccharum," In maple syrup production from Acer saccharum, the sap is extracted from the trees using a tap placed into a hole drilled through the phloem, just inside the bark"
Acer saccharum, The collected sap is then boiled
Acer saccharum," As the sap boils, the water is evaporated off and the syrup left behind"
Acer saccharum, Forty gallons of maple sap are required to be boiled to produce only 1 gallon of pure syrup
Acer saccharum," Syrup production is dependent on the tree growing in cooler climates; as such, sugar maples in the southern part of its range produce little sap"
Acer saccharum,"


=== Timber ===

The sapwood can be white, and smaller logs may have a higher proportion of this desirable wood"
Acer saccharum, Bowling alleys and bowling pins are both commonly manufactured from sugar maple
Acer saccharum," Trees with wavy woodgrain, which can occur in curly, quilted, and ""birdseye maple"" forms, are especially valued"
Acer saccharum," Maple is also the wood used for basketball courts, including the floors used by the NBA, and it is a popular wood for baseball bats, along with white ash"
Acer saccharum," In recent years, because white ash has become threatened by emerald ash borer, sugar maple wood has increasingly displaced it for baseball bat production"
Acer saccharum," It is also widely used in the manufacture of musical instruments, such as the members of the violin family (sides and back), guitars (neck), and drum shells"
Acer saccharum, It is also often used in the manufacture of sporting goods
Acer saccharum,"Canadian maple, often referred to as ""Canadian hardrock maple"", is prized for pool cues, especially the shafts"
Acer saccharum," Some production-line cues will use lower-quality maple wood with cosmetic issues, such as ""sugar marks"", which are most often light brown discolorations caused by sap in the wood"
Acer saccharum," The best shaft wood has a very consistent grain, with no marks or discoloration"
Acer saccharum," Sugar marks usually do not affect how the cue plays, but are not as high quality as those without it"
Acer saccharum, The wood is also used in gunstocks and flooring for its strength
Acer saccharum," Canadian hardrock maple is also used in the manufacture of electric guitar necks due to its high torsional stability and the bright, crisp resonant tone it produces"
Acer saccharum," If the grain is curly, with flame or quilt patterns, it's usually reserved for more expensive instruments"
Acer saccharum," In high-end guitars this wood is sometimes Torrefied to cook out the Lignin resins, allowing the greater stability to climate & environmental changes, and to enhance its tonal characteristics as the instrument's resonance is more evenly distributed across the cellulose structure of the wood without the lignin"
Acer saccharum,"


=== Urban planting ===

Sugar maple was a favorite street and park tree during the 19th century because it was easy to propagate and transplant, is fairly fast-growing, and has beautiful fall color"
Acer saccharum," As noted above, however, it proved too delicate to continue in that role after the rise of automobile-induced pollution and was replaced by Norway maple and other hardier species"
Acer saccharum," The shade and the shallow, fibrous roots may interfere with grass growing under the trees"
Acer saccharum," Deep, well-drained loam is the best rooting medium, although sugar maples can grow well on sandy soil which has a good buildup of humus"
Acer saccharum, Light (or loose) clay soils are also well known to support sugar maple growth
Acer saccharum," Poorly drained areas are unsuitable, and the species is especially short-lived on flood-prone clay flats"
Acer saccharum, Its salt tolerance is low and it is very sensitive to boron
Acer saccharum, The species is also subject to defoliation when there are dense populations of larvae of Lepidoptera species like the rosy maple moth (Dryocampa rubicunda)
Acer saccharum,"

Aesculus hippocastanum,Aesculus hippocastanum is a species of flowering plant in the soapberry and lychee family Sapindaceae
Aesculus hippocastanum," It is a large deciduous, synoecious (hermaphroditic-flowered) tree, commonly known as horse-chestnut or conker tree"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"


== Description ==
Aesculus hippocastanum is a large tree, growing to about 39 metres (128 ft) tall with a domed crown of stout branches; on old trees the outer branches are often pendulous with curled-up tips"
Aesculus hippocastanum," The leaves are opposite and palmately compound, with 5–7 leaflets; each leaflet is 13–30 centimetres (5"
Aesculus hippocastanum,1–11
Aesculus hippocastanum,"8 in) long, making the whole leaf up to 60 centimetres (24 in) across, with a 7–20 centimetres (2"
Aesculus hippocastanum,8–7
Aesculus hippocastanum,9 in) petiole
Aesculus hippocastanum," The leaf scars left on twigs after the leaves have fallen have a distinctive horseshoe shape, complete with seven ""nails"""
Aesculus hippocastanum, The flowers are usually white with a yellow to pink blotch at the base of the petals; they are produced in spring in erect panicles 10–30 cm tall with about 20–50 flowers on each panicle
Aesculus hippocastanum, Its pollens are not poisonous for honey bees
Aesculus hippocastanum," Usually only 1–5 fruits develop on each panicle; the shell is a green, spiky capsule containing one (rarely two or three) nut-like seeds called conkers or horse-chestnuts"
Aesculus hippocastanum, Each conker is 2–4 centimetres (0
Aesculus hippocastanum,79–1
Aesculus hippocastanum,"57 in) in diameter, glossy nut-brown with a whitish scar at the base"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"


== Etymology ==
The common name ""horse-chestnut"" (often unhyphenated) is reported as having originated from the erroneous belief that the tree was a kind of chestnut (though in fact only distantly related), together with the alleged observation that the fruit or seeds could help panting or coughing horses"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"


== Distribution and habitat ==
Aesculus hippocastanum is native to a small area in the Pindus Mountains mixed forests and Balkan mixed forests of South East Europe"
Aesculus hippocastanum," However, it can be found in many parts of Europe as far north as Gästrikland in Sweden, as well as in many parks and cities in the United States and Canada"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"


== Uses ==
It is widely cultivated in streets and parks throughout the temperate world, and has been particularly successful in places like Ireland, Great Britain and New Zealand, where they are commonly found in parks, streets and avenues"
Aesculus hippocastanum," Cultivation for its spectacular spring flowers is successful in a wide range of temperate climatic conditions provided summers are not too hot, with trees being grown as far north as Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the Faroe Islands, Reykjavík, Iceland and Harstad, Norway"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"
In Britain and Ireland, the seeds are used for the popular children's game conkers"
Aesculus hippocastanum," During the First World War, there was a campaign to ask for everyone (including children) to collect horse-chestnuts and donate them to the government"
Aesculus hippocastanum," The conkers were used as a source of starch for fermentation using the Clostridium acetobutylicum method devised by Chaim Weizmann to produce acetone for use as a solvent for the production of cordite, which was then used in military armaments"
Aesculus hippocastanum," Weizmann's process could use any source of starch, but the government chose to ask for conkers to avoid causing starvation by depleting food sources"
Aesculus hippocastanum," But conkers were found to be a poor source, and the factory only produced acetone for three months; however, they were collected again in the Second World War for the same reason"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"

The seeds, especially those that are young and fresh, are slightly poisonous, containing alkaloid saponins and glucosides"
Aesculus hippocastanum," Although not dangerous to touch, they cause sickness when eaten; consumed by horses, they can cause tremors and lack of coordination"
Aesculus hippocastanum,Though the seeds are said to repel spiders there is little evidence to support these claims
Aesculus hippocastanum, The presence of saponin may repel insects but it is not clear whether this is effective on spiders
Aesculus hippocastanum,"Horse-chestnuts have been affected by the leaf-mining moth Cameraria ohridella, whose larvae feed on horse chestnut leaves"
Aesculus hippocastanum, The moth was described from North Macedonia where the species was discovered in 1984 but took 18 years to reach Britain
Aesculus hippocastanum,"The flower is the symbol of the city of Kyiv, capital of Ukraine"
Aesculus hippocastanum," Although the horse-chestnut is sometimes known as the buckeye, this name is generally reserved for the New World members of the genus Aesculus"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"
In Germany, horse-chestnuts are often found in beer gardens, particularly in Bavaria"
Aesculus hippocastanum," Prior to the advent of mechanical refrigeration, brewers would dig cellars for lagering"
Aesculus hippocastanum," To further protect the cellars from the summer heat, they would plant chestnut trees, which have spreading, dense canopies but shallow roots which would not intrude on the caverns"
Aesculus hippocastanum, The practice of serving beer at these sites evolved into the modern beer garden
Aesculus hippocastanum,"


== Medical uses ==

The seed extract standardized to around 20 percent aescin (escin) is used for its venotonic effect, vascular protection, anti-inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties"
Aesculus hippocastanum, Primary indication is  chronic venous insufficiency
Aesculus hippocastanum," A Cochrane Review suggested that horse chestnut seed extract may be an efficacious and safe short-term treatment for chronic venous insufficiency, but definitive randomized controlled trials had not been conducted to confirm the efficacy"
Aesculus hippocastanum,Aescin reduces fluid leaks to surrounding tissue by reducing both the number and size of membrane pores in the veins
Aesculus hippocastanum,"


=== Safety in medical use ===
Two preparations are considered: whole horse chestnut extract (whole HCE) and purified β-aescin"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"  Historically, whole HCE has been used both for oral and IV routes (as of 2001)"
Aesculus hippocastanum," The rate of adverse effects is low; in a large German study, 0"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"6%, consisting mainly of gastrointestinal symptoms"
Aesculus hippocastanum," Dizziness, headache and itching have been reported"
Aesculus hippocastanum," One serious safety issue is rare cases of acute anaphylactic reactions, presumably in a context of whole HCE"
Aesculus hippocastanum, Purified β-aescin would be expected to have a better safety profile
Aesculus hippocastanum,"
Another is the risk of acute kidney injury, ""when patients, who had undergone cardiac surgery were given high doses of horse chestnut extract i"
Aesculus hippocastanum,v
Aesculus hippocastanum, for postoperative oedema
Aesculus hippocastanum," The phenomenon was dose dependent as no alteration in kidney function was recorded with 340 μg/kg, mild kidney function impairment developed with 360 μg/kg and acute kidney injury with 510 μg/kg"""
Aesculus hippocastanum, This almost certainly took place in a context of whole HCE
Aesculus hippocastanum,"
Three clinical trials were since performed to assess the effects of aescin on kidney function"
Aesculus hippocastanum, A total of 83 subjects were studied; 18 healthy volunteers given 10 or 20 mg iv
Aesculus hippocastanum," for 6 days, 40 in-patients with normal kidney function given 10 mg iv"
Aesculus hippocastanum, two times per day (except two children given 0
Aesculus hippocastanum,"2 mg/kg), 12 patients with cerebral oedema and normal kidney function given a massive iv"
Aesculus hippocastanum, dose on the day of surgery (49
Aesculus hippocastanum,2 ± 19
Aesculus hippocastanum,3 mg) and 15
Aesculus hippocastanum,4 ± 9
Aesculus hippocastanum,"4 mg daily for the following 10 days and 13 patients with impaired kidney function due to glomerulonephritis or pyelonephritis, who were given 20–25 mg iv"
Aesculus hippocastanum, daily for 6 days
Aesculus hippocastanum," ""In all studies renal function was monitored daily resorting to the usual tests of renal function: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, urinalysis"
Aesculus hippocastanum, In a selected number of cases paraaminohippurate and labelled EDTA clearance were also measured
Aesculus hippocastanum, No signs of development of renal impairment in the patients with normal renal function or of worsening of renal function in the patients with renal impairment were recorded
Aesculus hippocastanum,""" It is concluded that aescin has excellent tolerability in a clinical setting"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"Raw horse chestnut seed, leaf, bark and flower are toxic due to the presence of esculin and should not be ingested"
Aesculus hippocastanum, Horse chestnut seed is classified by the FDA as an unsafe herb
Aesculus hippocastanum, The glycoside and saponin constituents are considered toxic
Aesculus hippocastanum,Aesculus hippocastanum is used in the pseudoscientific Bach flower remedies
Aesculus hippocastanum," When the buds are used it is referred to as ""chestnut bud"" and when the flowers are used it is referred to as ""white chestnut"""
Aesculus hippocastanum,"


== Other chemicals ==
Quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside, a flavonol glycoside can also be found in horse chestnut seeds"
Aesculus hippocastanum," Leucocyanidin, leucodelphinidin and procyanidin A2 can also be found in horse chestnut"
Aesculus hippocastanum,"


== Anne Frank tree ==
A fine specimen of the horse-chestnut was the Anne Frank tree in the centre of Amsterdam, which she mentioned in her diary and which survived until August 2010, when a heavy wind blew it over"
Aesculus hippocastanum," Eleven young specimens, sprouted from seeds from this tree, were transported to the United States"
Aesculus hippocastanum," After a long quarantine in Indianapolis, each tree was shipped off to a new home at a notable museum or institution in the United States, such as the 9/11 Memorial Park, Central H"

Ailanthus altissima,97 in) wide
Ailanthus altissima," They have a long tapering end while the bases have two to four teeth, each containing one or more glands at the tip"
Ailanthus altissima," The leaflets' upper sides are dark green in color with light green veins, while the undersides are a more whitish green"
Ailanthus altissima, The petioles are 5 to 12 mm (0
Ailanthus altissima,20 to 0
Ailanthus altissima,47 in) long
Ailanthus altissima, The lobed bases and glands distinguish it from similar sumac species
Ailanthus altissima,"

The flowers are small and appear in large panicles up to 50 cm (20 in) in length at the end of new shoots"
Ailanthus altissima," The individual flowers are yellowish green to reddish in color, each with five petals and sepals"
Ailanthus altissima," The sepals are cup-shaped, lobed and united while the petals are valvate (i"
Ailanthus altissima,e
Ailanthus altissima," they meet at the edges without overlapping), white and hairy towards the inside"
Ailanthus altissima, They appear from mid-April in the south of its range to July in the north
Ailanthus altissima, A
Ailanthus altissima," altissima is dioecious, with male and female flowers being borne on different individuals"
Ailanthus altissima," Male trees produce three to four times as many flowers as the females, making the male flowers more conspicuous"
Ailanthus altissima," Furthermore, the male plants emit a foul-smelling odor while flowering to attract pollinating insects"
Ailanthus altissima, Female flowers contain ten (or rarely five through abortion) sterile stamens (stamenoides) with heart-shaped anthers
Ailanthus altissima, The pistil is made up of five free carpels (i
Ailanthus altissima,e
Ailanthus altissima," they are not fused), each containing a single ovule"
Ailanthus altissima, Their styles are united and slender with star-shaped stigmas
Ailanthus altissima," The male flowers are similar in appearance, but they of course lack a pistil and the stamens do function, each being topped with a globular anther and a glandular green disc"
Ailanthus altissima,  The fruits grow in clusters; a fruit cluster may contain hundreds of seeds
Ailanthus altissima, The seeds borne on the female trees are 5 mm in diameter and each is encapsulated in a samara that is 2
Ailanthus altissima,5 cm (0
Ailanthus altissima,98 in) long and 1 cm (0
Ailanthus altissima,"39 in) broad, appearing July though August, but can persist on the tree until the next spring"
Ailanthus altissima," The samara is large and twisted at the tips, making it spin as it falls, assisting wind dispersal, and aiding buoyancy for long-distance dispersal through hydrochory"
Ailanthus altissima, Primary wind dispersal and secondary water dispersal are usually positively correlated in A
Ailanthus altissima," altissima since most morphological characteristics of samaras affect both dispersal modes in the same way – except for the width of the samaras, which in contrast affects both types of dispersal in opposing ways, allowing differentiation in the dispersal strategies of this tree"
Ailanthus altissima," The females can produce huge amounts of seeds, normally around 30,000 per kilogram (14,000/lb) of tree,  and fecundity can be estimated non-destructively through measurements of dbh"

== Taxonomy ==
The first scientific descriptions of the tree of heaven were made shortly after it was introduced to Europe by the French Jesuit Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville"
Ailanthus altissima, D'Incarville had sent seeds from Peking via Siberia to his botanist friend Bernard de Jussieu in the 1740s
Ailanthus altissima," The seeds sent by d'Incarville were thought to be from the economically important and similar looking Chinese varnish tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum), which he had observed in the lower Yangtze region, rather than the tree of heaven"
Ailanthus altissima," D'Incarville attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades"
Ailanthus altissima," In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in France and sent others on to Philip Miller, the superintendent at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and to Philip C"
Ailanthus altissima," Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in Busbridge, England"
Ailanthus altissima,Confusion in naming began when the tree was described by all three men with three different names
Ailanthus altissima," In Paris, Linnaeus gave the plant the name Rhus succedanea, while it was known commonly as grand vernis du Japon"
Ailanthus altissima, In London the specimens were named by Miller as Toxicodendron altissima and in Busbridge it was dubbed in the old classification system as Rhus Sinese foliis alatis
Ailanthus altissima," There are extant records from the 1750s of disputes over the proper name between Philip Miller and John Ellis, curator of Webb's garden in Busbridge"
Ailanthus altissima," Rather than the issue being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant: Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart observed a specimen in Utrecht in 1782 and named it Rhus cacodendron"
Ailanthus altissima,"Light was shed on the taxonomic status of ailanthus in 1788 when René Louiche Desfontaines observed the samaras of the Paris specimens, which were still labelled Rhus succedanea, and came to the conclusion that the plant was not a sumac"
Ailanthus altissima," He published an article with an illustrated description and gave it the name Ailanthus glandulosa, placing it in the same genus as the tropical species then known as A"
Ailanthus altissima," integrifolia (white siris, now A"
Ailanthus altissima, triphysa)
Ailanthus altissima," The name is derived from the Ambonese word ailanto, meaning ""heaven-tree"" or ""tree reaching for the sky"""
Ailanthus altissima," The specific glandulosa, referring to the glands on the leaves, persisted until as late as 1957, but it was ultimately made invalid as a later homonym at the species level"
Ailanthus altissima, The current species name comes from Walter T
Ailanthus altissima, Swingle who was employed by the United States Department of Plant Industry
Ailanthus altissima," He decided to transfer Miller's older specific name into the genus of Desfontaines, resulting in the accepted name Ailanthus altissima"
Ailanthus altissima," Altissima is Latin for ""tallest"", and refers to the sizes the tree can reach"
Ailanthus altissima," The plant is sometimes incorrectly cited with the specific epithet in the masculine (glandulosus or altissimus), which is incorrect since botanical, like Classical Latin, treats most tree names as feminine"
Ailanthus altissima,"
There are three varieties of A"
Ailanthus altissima," altissima:

A"
Ailanthus altissima, altissima var
Ailanthus altissima," altissima, which is the type variety and is native to mainland China"
Ailanthus altissima,"
A"
Ailanthus altissima, altissima var
Ailanthus altissima," tanakai, which is endemic to northern Taiwan highlands"
Ailanthus altissima," It differs from the type in having yellowish bark, odd-pinnate leaves that are also shorter on average at 45 to 60 cm (18 to 24 in) long with only 13–25 scythe-like leaflets"
Ailanthus altissima, It is listed as endangered in the IUCN Red List of threatened species due to loss of habitat for building and industrial plantations
Ailanthus altissima,"

== Distribution and habitat ==
A"
Ailanthus altissima," altissima is native to northern and central China, Taiwan and northern Korea"
Ailanthus altissima," It was historically widely distributed, and the fossil record indicates clearly that it was present in North America as recently as the middle Miocene"
Ailanthus altissima, In Taiwan it is present as var
Ailanthus altissima, takanai
Ailanthus altissima," In China it is native to every province except Gansu, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Jilin, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet"
Ailanthus altissima, It has been introduced in many regions across the world
Ailanthus altissima,"The tree prefers moist and loamy soils, but is adaptable to a very wide range of soil conditions and pH values"
Ailanthus altissima," It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of flooding"
Ailanthus altissima, It also does not tolerate deep shade
Ailanthus altissima, In China it is often found in limestone-rich areas
Ailanthus altissima, The tree of heaven is found within a wide range of climatic conditions
Ailanthus altissima, In its native range it is found at high altitudes in Taiwan as well as lower ones in mainland China
Ailanthus altissima, These are virtually found anywhere in the U
Ailanthus altissima,S
Ailanthus altissima,", but especially in arid regions bordering the Great Plains, very wet regions in the southern Appalachians, cold areas of the lower Rocky Mountains and throughout much of the California Central Valley, forming dense thickets that displace native plants"
Ailanthus altissima," Prolonged cold and snow cover cause dieback, although the trees resprout from the roots"
Ailanthus altissima,"


=== As an exotic plant ===
The earliest introductions of A"
Ailanthus altissima, altissima to countries outside of its native range were to the southern areas of Korea as well as to Japan
Ailanthus altissima," It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that the tree was a very early introduction"
Ailanthus altissima," Within China itself it has also been naturalized beyond its native range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang"
Ailanthus altissima,"In 1784, not long after Jussieu had sent seeds to England, some were forwarded to the United States by William Hamilton, a gardener in Philadelphia"
Ailanthus altissima," In both Europe and America it quickly became a favoured ornamental, especially as a street tree, and by 1840 it was available in most nurseries"
Ailanthus altissima, The tree was separately brought to California in the 1890s by Chinese immigrants who came during the California Gold Rush
Ailanthus altissima," It has escaped cultivation in all areas where it was introduced, but most extensively in the United States"
Ailanthus altissima," It has naturalized across much of Europe, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, the Pannonian region (i"
Ailanthus altissima,e
Ailanthus altissima," southeastern Central Europe around the Danube river basin from Austria, Slovakia and Hungary south to the Balkan ranges) and most countries of the Mediterranean Basin"
Ailanthus altissima, In Montenegro and Albania A
Ailanthus altissima," altissima is widespread in both rural and urban areas and while in the first it was introduced as an ornamental plant, it very soon invaded native ecosystems with disastrous results and became an invasive species"
Ailanthus altissima," Ailanthus has also been introduced to Argentina, Australia (where it is a declared weed in New South Wales and Victoria), New Zealand (where it is listed under the National Pest Plant Accord and is classed an ""unwanted organism""), the Middle East and in some countries in South Asia such as Pakistan"
Ailanthus altissima," In South Africa it is listed as an invasive species which must be controlled, or removed and destroyed"
Ailanthus altissima,"In North America, A"
Ailanthus altissima," altissima is present from Massachusetts in the east, west to southern Ontario, southwest to Iowa, south to Texas, and east to the north of Florida"
Ailanthus altissima, On the west coast it is found from New Mexico west to California and north to Washington
Ailanthus altissima," In the east of its range it grows most extensively in disturbed areas of cities, where it was long ago present as a planted street tree"
Ailanthus altissima, It also grows along roads and railways
Ailanthus altissima," For example, a 2003 study in North Carolina found the tree of heaven was present on 1"
Ailanthus altissima,7% of all highway and railroad edges in the state and had been expanding its range at the rate of 4
Ailanthus altissima,76% counties per year
Ailanthus altissima," Similarly, another study conducted in southwestern Virginia determined that the tree of heaven is thriving along approximately 30% of the state's interstate highway system length or mileage"
Ailanthus altissima, It sometimes enters undisturbed areas as well and competes with native plants
Ailanthus altissima, In western North America it is most common in mountainous areas around old dwellings and abandoned mining operations
Ailanthus altissima," It is classified as a noxious or invasive plant on National Forest System lands and in many states because its prolific seed production, high germination rates and capacity to regrow from roots and root fragments enable A"
Ailanthus altissima, altissima to out-compete native species
Ailanthus altissima," For this reason, control measures on public lands and private property are advised where A"
Ailanthus altissima, altissima has naturalized
Ailanthus altissima,"


== Ecology ==

Tree of heaven is an opportunistic plant that thrives in full sun and disturbed areas"
Ailanthus altissima," It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively by root sprouts, re-sprouting rapidly after being cut"
Ailanthus altissima," It is considered a shade-intolerant tree and cannot compete in low-light situations, though it is sometimes found competing with hardwoods, but such competition rather indicates it was present at the time the stand was established"
Ailanthus altissima," On the other hand, a study in an old-growth hemlock-hardwood forest in New York found that Ailanthus was capable of competing successfully with native trees in canopy gaps where only 2 to 15% of full sun was available"
Ailanthus altissima," The same study characterised the tree as using a ""gap-obligate"" strategy in order to reach the forest canopy, meaning it grows rapidly during a very short period rather than growing slowly over a long period"
Ailanthus altissima, It is a short lived tree in any location and rarely lives more than 50 years
Ailanthus altissima," Ailanthus is among the most pollution-tolerant of tree species, including sulfur dioxide, which it absorbs in its leaves"
Ailanthus altissima," It can withstand cement dust and fumes from coal tar operations, as well as resist ozone exposure relatively well"
Ailanthus altissima," Furthermore, high concentrations of mercury have been found built up in tissues of the plant"
Ailanthus altissima,Ailanthus has been used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine drainage has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4
Ailanthus altissima,1 (approximately that of tomato juice)
Ailanthus altissima, It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels
Ailanthus altissima, The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system
Ailanthus altissima, It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive
Ailanthus altissima, The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes
Ailanthus altissima," Along highways, it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition"
Ailanthus altissima, The roots are poisonous to people
Ailanthus altissima,"

Ailanthus produces an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits the growth of other plants"
Ailanthus altissima," The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant"
Ailanthus altissima, One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating
Ailanthus altissima," The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv"
Ailanthus altissima, Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv
Ailanthus altissima, Silver Queen)
Ailanthus altissima," It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings with the exception of velvetleaf, which showed some resistance"
Ailanthus altissima," Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected"
Ailanthus altissima," The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A"
Ailanthus altissima, altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity
Ailanthus altissima, Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure
Ailanthus altissima, Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them
Ailanthus altissima, Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts
Ailanthus altissima,"

The tree of heaven is a very rapidly growing tree, possibly the fastest growing tree in North America"
Ailanthus altissima, Growth of one to two metres (3
Ailanthus altissima,3 to 6
Ailanthus altissima,6 ft) per year for the first four years is considered normal
Ailanthus altissima, Shade considerably hampers growth rates
Ailanthus altissima," Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees"
Ailanthus altissima," Studies found that Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones"
Ailanthus altissima,In northern Europe the tree of heaven was not considered naturalised in cities until after the Second World War
Ailanthus altissima, This has been attributed to the tree's ability to colonize areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow
Ailanthus altissima," In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas (it is thought that the tree requires a mean annual temperature of 8 degrees Celsius to grow well, which limits its spread to more northern and higher altitude areas)"
Ailanthus altissima," For example, one study in Germany found the tree of heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether"
Ailanthus altissima, In other areas of Europe this is not the case as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish
Ailanthus altissima," It has colonized natural areas in Hungary, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that country's Aggtelek National Park"
Ailanthus altissima,"Several species of Lepidoptera utilise the leaves of ailanthus as food, including the Indian moon moth (Actias selene) and the common grass yellow (Eurema hecabe)"
Ailanthus altissima," In North America the tree is the host plant for the ailanthus webworm (Atteva aurea), though this ermine moth is native to Central and South America and originally used other members of the mostly tropical Simaroubaceae as its hosts"
Ailanthus altissima, In its native range A
Ailanthus altissima, altissima is associated with at least 32 species of arthropods and 13 species of fungi
Ailanthus altissima,"In North America, the leaves of ailanthus are sometimes attacked by Aculops ailanthii, a mite in the family Eriophyidae"
Ailanthus altissima," Leaves infested by the mite begin to curl and become glossy, reducing their ability to function"
Ailanthus altissima," Therefore, this species has been proposed as a possible biocontrol for ailanthus in the Americas"
Ailanthus altissima,"Due to the tree of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control in order to keep its populations in check"
Ailanthus altissima," For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an eradication program for the tree"
Ailanthus altissima," It can be very difficult to eradicate, however"
Ailanthus altissima," Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical"
Ailanthus altissima," A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible"
Ailanthus altissima," All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control"
Ailanthus altissima," It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth"
Ailanthus altissima,"


== Uses ==

In addition to its use as an ornamental plant, the tree of heaven is also used for its wood and as a host plant to feed silkworms of the moth Samia cynthia, which produces silk that is stronger and cheaper than mulberry silk, although with inferior gloss and texture"
Ailanthus altissima, It is also unable to take dye
Ailanthus altissima," This type of silk is known under various names: ""pongee"", ""eri silk"" and ""Shantung silk"", the last name being derived from Shandong Province in China where this silk is often produced"
Ailanthus altissima, Its production is particularly well known in the Yantai region of that province
Ailanthus altissima, The moth has also been introduced in the United States
Ailanthus altissima,"The pale yellow, close-grained and satiny wood of ailanthus has been used in cabinet work"
Ailanthus altissima," It is flexible and well suited to the manufacture of kitchen steamers, which are important in Chinese cuisine for cooking mantou, pastries and rice"
Ailanthus altissima, Zhejiang Province in eastern China is most famous for producing these steamers
Ailanthus altissima," It is also considered a good source of firewood across much of its range as it is moderately hard and heavy, yet readily available"
Ailanthus altissima, The wood is also used to make charcoal for culinary purposes
Ailanthus altissima,"  There are problems with using the wood as lumber, however"
Ailanthus altissima," Because the trees exhibit rapid growth for the first few years, the trunk has uneven texture between the inner and outer wood, which can cause the wood to twist or crack during drying"
Ailanthus altissima," Techniques have been developed for drying the wood so as to prevent this cracking, allowing it to be commercially harvested"
Ailanthus altissima," Although the live tree tends to have very flexible wood, the wood is quite hard once properly dried"
Ailanthus altissima,"


=== Cultivation ===
Tree of heaven is a popular ornamental tree in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions"
Ailanthus altissima," It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit"
Ailanthus altissima," The problem of odor was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results"
Ailanthus altissima," Michael Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers"
Ailanthus altissima," He further writes (his emphasis): For most landscaping conditions, it has no value as there are too many trees of superior quality; for impossible conditions this tree has a place; selection could be made for good habit, strong wood and better foliage which would make the tree more satisfactory; I once talked with an architect who tried to buy Ailanthus for use along polluted highways but could not find an adequate supply ["
Ailanthus altissima,
Ailanthus altissima,
Ailanthus altissima,"]

In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive as it is in America"
Ailanthus altissima," In the United Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia"
Ailanthus altissima," It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland"
Ailanthus altissima, It is also rare in Ireland
Ailanthus altissima, In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens
Ailanthus altissima," The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds"
Ailanthus altissima,"A few cultivars exist, but they are not often sold outside of China and probably not at all in North America:

‘Hongye’ – The name is Chinese and means ""red leaves"""
Ailanthus altissima," As the name implies it has attractive vivid red foliage
‘Thousand Leaders’
‘Metro’ – A male cultivar with a tighter crown than usual and a less weedy habit
‘Erythrocarpa’ – The fruits are a striking red
‘Pendulifolia’ – Leaves are much longer and hang elegantly


=== Traditional medicine ===
Nearly every part of A"
Ailanthus altissima, altissima has some application in Chinese traditional medicine
Ailanthus altissima," One of the oldest recipes, recorded in a work from AD 732, is used for treating mental illness"
Ailanthus altissima," It involved chopped root material, young boys' urine and douchi"
Ailanthus altissima," After sitting for a day, the liquid was strained out and given to an ill person over the course of several days"
Ailanthus altissima,"Another source from 684 AD, during the Tang dynasty and recorded in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states that when the leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally, they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches"
Ailanthus altissima," This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth"
Ailanthus altissima,"The dried bark, however, is listed in the modern Chinese materia medica as chun bai pi (Chinese: 椿白皮; pinyin: chūnbáipí), meaning ""white bark of spring"""
Ailanthus altissima," Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its possible uses"
Ailanthus altissima," It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion, which is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally cut into strips"
Ailanthus altissima, The bark is said to have cooling and astringent properties
Ailanthus altissima," It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10 grams, so as not to poison people"
Ailanthus altissima, Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark
Ailanthus altissima, A tincture of the root-bark has been claimed to have been used successfully by American herbalists in the 19th century
Ailanthus altissima," It contains phytochemicals, such as quassin and saponin, and ailanthone"
Ailanthus altissima, It is available in most shops dealing in Chinese traditional medicine
Ailanthus altissima," The samaras are also used in modern Chinese medicine under the name feng yan cao (simplified Chinese: 凤眼草; traditional Chinese: 鳳眼草; pinyin: fèngyǎncǎo), meaning ""herbal phoenix eye"""
Ailanthus altissima,The plant may be mildly toxic
Ailanthus altissima," The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, which developed weakness and paralysis"
Ailanthus altissima," It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as quassinoids"
Ailanthus altissima,"


== Culture ==


=== China ===
In addition to the tree of heaven's various uses, it has also been a part of Chinese culture for many centuries and has more recently attained a similar status in the west"
Ailanthus altissima," Within the oldest extant Chinese dictionary, the Erya, written in the 3rd century BC, the tree of heaven is mentioned second among a list of trees"
Ailanthus altissima, It was mentioned again in a materia medica compiled during the Tang dynasty in 656 AD
Ailanthus altissima," Each work favoured a different character, however, and there is still some debate in the Chinese botanical community as to which character should be used"
Ailanthus altissima," The current name, chouchun (Chinese: 臭椿; pinyin: chòuchūn), means ""stinking spring"", and is a relatively new appellation"
Ailanthus altissima," People living near the lower Yellow River know it by the name chunshu (simplified Chinese: 椿树; traditional Chinese: 椿樹; pinyin: chūnshù), meaning ""spring tree"""
Ailanthus altissima, The name stems from the fact that A
Ailanthus altissima," altissima is one of the last trees to come out of dormancy, and as such its leaves coming out would indicate that winter was truly over"
Ailanthus altissima,"In Chinese literature, ailanthus is often used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing a father and a stump being a spoiled child"
Ailanthus altissima," This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write ""wishing your ailanthus and daylily are strong and happy"", with ailanthus metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother"
Ailanthus altissima," Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a ""good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout"", meaning the child is irresponsible"
Ailanthus altissima," This derives from the literature of Zhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape"
Ailanthus altissima," Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions"
Ailanthus altissima,"


=== United States ===
The 1943 book A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith uses the tree of heaven as its central metaphor, using it as an analogy for the ability to thrive in a difficult environment"
Ailanthus altissima," At that time as well as now, ailanthus was common in neglected urban areas"
Ailanthus altissima, She writes:There's a tree that grows in Brooklyn
Ailanthus altissima, Some people call it the Tree of Heaven
Ailanthus altissima," No matter where its seed falls, it makes a tree which struggles to reach the sky"
Ailanthus altissima, It grows in boarded up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps
Ailanthus altissima, It grows up out of cellar gratings
Ailanthus altissima, It is the only tree that grows out of cement
Ailanthus altissima, It grows lushly
Ailanthus altissima,
Ailanthus altissima,
Ailanthus altissima,"survives without sun, water, and seemingly earth"
Ailanthus altissima, It would be considered beautiful except that there are too many of it
Ailanthus altissima,"

In William Faulkner's novel, Sanctuary, a ""heaven-tree"" stands outside the Jefferson jail, where Lee Goodwin and a ""negro murderer"" are incarcerated"
Ailanthus altissima, The tree is associated with the black prisoner's despair in the face of his impending execution and the spirituals that he sings in chorus with other black people who keep a sort of vigil in the street below:
Ailanthus altissima,
Ailanthus altissima,
Ailanthus altissima,"they sang spirituals while white people slowed and stopped in the leafed darkness that was almost summer, to listen to those who were sure to die and him who was already dead singing about heaven and being tired; or perhaps in the interval between songs a rich, sourceless voice coming out of the high darkness where the ragged shadow of the heaven-tree which snooded the street lamp at the corner fretted and mourned: ""Fo days mo! Den dey ghy stroy de bes ba'yton singer in nawth Mississippi!""
Upon the barred and slitted wall the splotched shadow of the heaven-tree shuddered and pulsed monstrously in scarce any wind; rich and sad, the singing fell behind"
Ailanthus altissima,"In the 2013 book Teardown: Memoir of a Vanishing City by journalist Gordon Young, the tree is referenced in a description of the Carriage Town neighborhood in Flint, Michigan"
Ailanthus altissima,"Festive Victorian-era homes in various stages of restoration battled for supremacy with boarded-up firetraps and overgrown lots landscaped with weeds, garbage, and “ghetto palms,” a particularly hardy invasive species known more formally as Ailanthus altissima, or the tree of heaven, perhaps because only God can kill the things"
Ailanthus altissima," Around the corner, business was brisk at a drug house where residents and customers alike weren’t above casually taking a piss in the driveway"
Ailanthus altissima,"
Ailanthus is also sometimes counter-nicknamed ""tree from hell"" due to its prolific invasiveness and the difficulty in eradicating it"
Ailanthus altissima," In certain parts of the United States, the species has been nicknamed the ""ghetto palm"" because of its propensity for growing in the inhospitable conditions of urban areas, or on abandoned and poorly maintained properties, such as in war-torn Afghanistan"
Ailanthus altissima,"Until March 26, 2008, a 60-foot (18 m)-tall member of the species was a prominent ""centerpiece"" of the sculpture garden at the Noguchi Museum in the Astoria section in the borough of Queens in New York City"
Ailanthus altissima, The tree had been spared by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi when in 1975 he bought the building which would become the museum and cleaned up its back lot

Asimina triloba," It belongs to the genus Asimina in the same plant family (the Annonaceae) as the custard-apple, cherimoya, sweetsop, ylang-ylang and soursop"
Asimina triloba,"
The pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottom-land and hilly upland habitat, with large, simple leaves"
Asimina triloba," Pawpaw fruits are the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States (not counting gourds, which are typically considered vegetables rather than fruit for culinary purposes, although in botany they are classified as fruit)"
Asimina triloba,"Pawpaw fruits have a sweet, custardish flavor somewhat similar to banana, mango, and pineapple, and are commonly eaten raw, but are also used to make ice cream and baked desserts"
Asimina triloba,"


== Names ==
This plant's scientific name is Asimina triloba"
Asimina triloba, The genus name Asimina is adapted from the Native American (probably Miami-Illinois) name assimin or rassimin through the French colonial asiminier
Asimina triloba," The epithet triloba in the species' scientific name refers to the flowers' three-lobed calices and doubly three-lobed corollas, the shape not unlike a tricorne hat"
Asimina triloba,"
The common name of this species is variously spelled pawpaw, paw paw, paw-paw, and papaw"
Asimina triloba," It probably derives from the Spanish papaya, an American tropical and sub-tropical fruit (Carica papaya) sometimes also called ""papaw"", perhaps because of the superficial similarity of their fruits and the fact that both have very large leaves"
Asimina triloba," The name pawpaw or papaw, first recorded in print in English in 1598, originally meant the giant herb Carica papaya or its fruit (as it still commonly does in many English-speaking communities, including Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa)"
Asimina triloba, Daniel F

Asimina triloba,"


== Description ==

Asimina triloba is a large shrub or small tree growing to a height of 35 feet (11 m), rarely as tall as 45 feet (14 m), with trunks 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) or more in diameter"
Asimina triloba," The large leaves of pawpaw trees are clustered symmetrically at the ends of the branches, giving a distinctive imbricated appearance to the tree's foliage"
Asimina triloba,"The leaves of the species are simple, alternate and spirally arranged, entire, deciduous, obovate-lanceolate, 10–12 inches (25–30 cm) long, 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) broad, and wedge-shaped at the base, with an acute apex and an entire margin, with the midrib and primary veins prominent"
Asimina triloba," The petioles are short and stout, with a prominent adaxial groove"
Asimina triloba, Stipules are lacking
Asimina triloba," The expanding leaves are conduplicate, green, covered with rusty tomentum beneath, and hairy above; when fully grown they are smooth, dark green above, and paler beneath"

Asimina triloba," In autumn the leaves are a rusty yellow, allowing pawpaw groves to be spotted from a long distance"
Asimina triloba,"Pawpaw flowers are perfect, about 1–2 inches (3–5 cm) across, rich red-purple or maroon when mature, with three sepals and six petals"
Asimina triloba," They are borne singly on stout, hairy, axillary peduncles"
Asimina triloba," The flowers are produced in early spring at the same time as or slightly before the new leaves appear, and have a faint fetid or yeasty smell"

== Range and ecology ==

Asimina triloba, the pawpaw, is native to the Eastern, Southern, and Midwestern United States and adjacent Ontario, Canada, from New York west to southeastern Nebraska, and south to northern Florida and eastern Texas"
Asimina triloba,"The tree commonly grows in floodplains and shady, rich bottomlands, where it often forms a dense, clonally spreading undergrowth in the forest, often appearing as a patch or thicket of individual small slender trees"
Asimina triloba," Pawpaws are not the first to colonize a disturbed site (arriving roughly four years after a clearcut), but may become dominant and slow the establishment of oaks and hickories"
Asimina triloba," Although shade-tolerant, pawpaws do not persist in undisturbed old growth forest"
Asimina triloba," Pawpaws spread locally primarily by root suckers; sexual reproduction by seed does also occur, but at a fairly low rate"
Asimina triloba,"Pawpaw flowers are insect-pollinated, but fruit production is sometimes limited as few if any pollinators are attracted to the flower's faint, or sometimes non-existent scent"
Asimina triloba, The flowers produce an odor similar to that of rotting meat to attract blowflies or carrion beetles for cross pollination
Asimina triloba," Other insects that are attracted to pawpaw flowers include scavenging fruit flies, carrion flies and beetles"
Asimina triloba," Because of irregular fruit production, some believe pawpaw plants are self-incompatible, requiring cross-pollination between trees of different clones (patches)"
Asimina triloba,"The fruits of the pawpaw are eaten by a variety of mammals, including raccoons, gray foxes, opossums, squirrels, and black bears"
Asimina triloba,"The disagreeable-smelling leaves, twigs, and bark of pawpaws contain natural insecticides known as acetogenins"
Asimina triloba," Pawpaw leaves and twigs are seldom consumed by rabbits, deer, or goats, or by many insects"
Asimina triloba," However, mules have been seen eating pawpaw leaves in Maryland"
Asimina triloba,"Larvae of the zebra swallowtail (Protographium marcellus), a butterfly, feed exclusively on young leaves of Asimina triloba and various other pawpaw (Asimina) species, but never occur in great numbers on the plants"
Asimina triloba," Chemicals in the pawpaw leaves confer protection from predation throughout the butterfly's life, as trace amounts of acetogenins remain present, making them unpalatable to birds and other predators"
Asimina triloba,"


== Conservation status ==
On a global (range-wide) scale, the common pawpaw (Asimina triloba) has a NatureServe global conservation rank of G5 (very common)"
Asimina triloba,"
In the United States, the species has a NatureServe national conservation rank of N5 (very common), but is considered a threatened species in New York, and an endangered species in New Jersey"
Asimina triloba,"
In Canada, where the species is found only in portions of southern Ontario, it has a NatureServe national conservation rank of N3 (vulnerable), and a NatureServe subnational conservation rank of S3 (vulnerable) in Ontario"
Asimina triloba," The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has given the species a general status of ""Sensitive"", and its populations there are monitored"
Asimina triloba,"
In areas in which deer populations are dense, pawpaws appear to be becoming more abundant locally, since the deer avoid them but consume seedlings of most other woody plants"
Asimina triloba,"


== History ==
The natural distribution of the common pawpaw (Asimina triloba) in North America, prior to the Ice Ages and lasting until roughly 10,000 years ago, was done by certain megafauna up until they became extinct during the Quaternary extinction event"
Asimina triloba,"  After the arrival of humans and the subsequent extinction of megafauna that were distributing Asimina triloba, the probable distribution of these large fruit-bearing plants has been by humans"
Asimina triloba,"The earliest documented mention of pawpaws is in the 1541 report of the Spanish de Soto expedition, who found Native Americans cultivating it east of the Mississippi River"
Asimina triloba, The Lewis and Clark Expedition consumed pawpaws during their travels
Asimina triloba," Chilled pawpaw fruit was a favorite dessert of George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson planted it at Monticello, his home in Virginia"
Asimina triloba,"


== Cultivation ==
In cultivation, lack of successful pollination is the most common cause of poor fruiting"
Asimina triloba, Cultivation is best in hardiness zones 5-9 and trees take 7-8 years from seedling to fruiting
Asimina triloba," Cross-pollination of at least two different genetic varieties of the plant is recommended, and growers often resort to hand pollination or to use of pollinator attractants such as spraying fish emulsion or hanging chicken necks or other meat near the open flowers to attract pollinators"
Asimina triloba," While pawpaws are larval hosts for the zebra swallowtail butterfly, these caterpillars are usually present only at low density, and not detrimental to the foliage of the trees"
Asimina triloba,"Pawpaws have never been cultivated for their fruits on the scale of apples or peaches, primarily because pawpaw fruits ripen to the point of fermentation soon after they are picked, and only frozen fruit will store or ship well"
Asimina triloba," Other methods of preservation include dehydration, production of jams or jellies, and pressure canning (using the numerical values for bananas)"
Asimina triloba,"
Cultivation of pawpaws for fruit production has attracted interest, particularly among organic growers, as a fruit with few to no pests that can successfully be grown in its native environment without pesticides"
Asimina triloba," The commercial cultivation and harvesting of pawpaws is strong in southeastern Ohio and also being explored in Kentucky and Maryland, as well as various areas outside the species' native range, including California, the Pacific Northwest, and Massachusetts"
Asimina triloba, Kentucky State University is the site of the USDA National Clonal Germplasm Repository for asimina species
Asimina triloba,"The pawpaw is also gaining in popularity among landscapers and backyard gardeners because of the tree's distinctive growth habit, the appeal of its fresh fruit, and its relatively low maintenance needs once established"
Asimina triloba,"


=== Propagation ===

Trees are easily grown from seed"
Asimina triloba, It is easiest to simply plant an entire fruit in the ground or place a seed in the ground immediately upon eating the fruit
Asimina triloba, Seeds should not be dried out as they will lose viability if they dehydrate to 5% moisture
Asimina triloba, The seeds need to be stratified by moist cold storage for 60-100 days at 35–45 °F (2–7 °C) (some publications suggest 90-120 days)
Asimina triloba, They will lose their viability if stored for 3 years or more; some seeds survive if stored for 2 years
Asimina triloba, Germination is hypogeal and cotyledons remain within the seed coat
Asimina triloba," Strictly speaking, hypogeal means the cotyledons stay in the soil, acting as a food store for the seedling until the plumule emerges from the soil on the epicotyl or true stem"
Asimina triloba," However, pawpaw seeds have occasionally been observed to emerge from the ground and form the true stem and plumule above ground"
Asimina triloba,"
Propagation using cuttings has generally not been successful"
Asimina triloba,Desirable cultivars are propagated by chip budding or whip grafting onto a root stock
Asimina triloba," Pawpaw seeds do not grow ""true to type"" — each individual seed in a fruit is genetically different from each other and from its parent tree"
Asimina triloba," Purchased cultivars do not produce seeds true to type, either, which is why cultivars are all grafted trees"
Asimina triloba," Root sucker seedlings, however, are all genetically identical to its host"
Asimina triloba,"Commercial nurseries usually ship seedlings in containers, usually grafted cultivars, but other nurseries such as the Kentucky Division of Forestry ship bareroot seedlings for reforestation projects and area homeowners"
Asimina triloba,"Harvesting seedlings from the forest floor is tricky because most forest-floor seedlings are actually root suckers with few roots, and those seedlings that did grow from a seed have deep taproots"
Asimina triloba,"Blowflies, such as C"
Asimina triloba," vomitoria, are known pollinators of these plants"
Asimina triloba," 


=== Cultivars ===
Over the years many cultivars of Asimina triloba have been developed or discovered"
Asimina triloba, Many have been lost and are no longer available commercially
Asimina triloba,"The named varieties producing large fruit and performing well in Kentucky per research trials are NC-1, Overleese, Potomac, Shenandoah, Sunflower, Susquehanna, Wabash, KSU-Atwood, KSU-Benson and KSY-Chappell"
Asimina triloba,"


=== Habitat restoration ===
Pawpaws are sometimes included in ecological restoration plantings since this tree grows well in wet soil and has a strong tendency to form well-rooted colonial thickets"
Asimina triloba,"


== Uses ==


=== Fruits ===
As described by horticulturist Barbara Damrosch, the fruit of the pawpaw ""looks a bit like mango, but with pale yellow, custardy, spoonable flesh and black, easy-to-remove seeds"
Asimina triloba,""" Wild-collected pawpaw fruits, ripe in late August to mid-September, have long been a favorite treat throughout the tree's extensive native range in eastern North America, and on occasion are sold locally at farmers' markets"
Asimina triloba," Pawpaw fruits have a sweet,  custard-like flavor somewhat similar to banana, mango, and cantaloupe, varying significantly by source or cultivar, with more protein than most fruits"
Asimina triloba, Nineteenth-century American agronomist E
Asimina triloba," Lewis Sturtevant described pawpaws as

"
Asimina triloba,
Asimina triloba,
Asimina triloba," a natural custard, too luscious for the relish of most people
Ohio botanist William B"
Asimina triloba," Werthner noted that 

The fruit "
Asimina triloba,
Asimina triloba,
Asimina triloba, has a tangy wild-wood flavor peculiarly its own
Asimina triloba," It is sweet, yet rather cloying to the taste and a wee bit puckery 
Fresh fruits of the pawpaw are commonly eaten raw, either chilled or at room temperature"
Asimina triloba," However, they can be kept only 2–3 days at room temperature, or about a week if refrigerated"
Asimina triloba, The easily bruised pawpaw fruits do not ship well unless frozen
Asimina triloba," Where pawpaws grow, the fruit pulp is also often used locally in baked dessert recipes, with pawpaw often substituted with volumetric equivalency in many banana-based recipes"
Asimina triloba, Pawpaws may also be blended into ice cream or included in pancakes
Asimina triloba,"Due to essential oils on leaves, bark, and the fruit skin, handling pawpaw may cause contact dermatitis and a skin rash in some people"
Asimina triloba,"


==== Nutrition ====
According to a report from the Kentucky State University Pawpaw Program (right table), raw pawpaw (with skin) in a 100 gram amount provides 80 Calories and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (22% DV), magnesium (32% DV), iron (54% DV) and manganese (124% DV)"
Asimina triloba, The fruit also contains a moderate amount (10–19% DV) of vitamin A (11% DV)
Asimina triloba,"


=== Phytochemicals ===

Phytochemical extracts of the leaves and fruit contain acetogenins, including the neurotoxin annonacin"
Asimina triloba," The seeds and bark contain the chemical asimitrin and other acetogenins, including asimin, asiminacin and asiminecin"
Asimina triloba,"


=== Effect on insects ===
Due to the presence of acetogenins, the leaves, twigs, and bark of pawpaw trees can be used to make an organic insecticide"
Asimina triloba," The one notable exception is the zebra swallowtail butterfly (Eurytides marcellus), whose larvae feed on the leaves of various species of Asimina, conferring protection from predation throughout the butterfly's life, as trace amounts of acetogenins remain present, making them unpalatable to birds and other predators"
Asimina triloba,"


=== Historical uses ===
The tough, fibrous inner bark of the pawpaw was used by Native Americans and settlers in the Midwest for making ropes, fishing nets, mats, and for stringing fish"
Asimina triloba,Pawpaw logs have been used for split-rail fences in Arkansas
Asimina triloba,"The hard, brown, shiny lima-bean-sized seeds were sometimes carried as pocket pieces in Ohio"
Asimina triloba,"


== Cultural significance ==


=== Old song ===
A traditional American folk song portrays wild harvesting of pawpaws; Arty Schronce of the Georgia Department of Agriculture gives these lyrics:

He notes that ""picking up pawpaws"" refers to gathering the ripe, fallen fruit from beneath the trees, and that the ""pocket"" in the song is that of an apron or similar tie-on pocket, not a modern pants or blue jeans pocket, into which pawpaws would hardly fit"
Asimina triloba," A ""pawpaw patch"" refers to the plant's characteristic patch-forming clonal growth habit"
Asimina triloba,"

Betula nigra, It is one of the few heat-tolerant birches in a family of mostly cold-weather trees which do not thrive in USDA Zone 6 and up
Betula nigra, B
Betula nigra, nigra commonly occurs in floodplains and swamps
Betula nigra,"


== Description ==
Betula nigra is a deciduous tree growing to 25–30 meters (80–100 ft) with a trunk 50 to 150 centimeters (20 to 60 in) in diameter"
Betula nigra, The base of the tree is often divided into multiple slender trunks
Betula nigra,"Bark
Bark characteristics of the river birch differ during its youth stage, maturation, and old growth"
Betula nigra," The bark of a young river birch can vary from having a salmon-pink to brown-gray tint and can be described as having loose layers of curling, paper thin scales"
Betula nigra," As the tree matures, the salmon-pink color is exchanged for a reddish-brown with a dark grey base color"
Betula nigra," The scales on a mature tree lack the loose curling and are closely pressed into thick, irregular plates"
Betula nigra, These scales are slightly separated from the trunk and can shift outward to the side
Betula nigra," Once the River Birch ages past maturity, the scales become thicker towards the base of the trunk and are divided in deep furrows"
Betula nigra,"Leaves and Fruit
The twigs are glabrous or thinly hairy"
Betula nigra," There is an absence of terminal buds, and lateral buds often have a hook at the tip of the bud, which differs from other species in the family Betulaceae"
Betula nigra,"  The leaves are alternate, ovate, 4–8 centimeters (1 1⁄2–3 1⁄4 in) long and 3–6 centimeters (1 1⁄4–2 1⁄4 in) broad, with a serrated margin and five to twelve pairs of veins"
Betula nigra," The upper surface of the leaf is dark green in color, while the underside can be described as having a light yellow-green color"
Betula nigra," The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins 3–6 centimeters (1 1⁄4–2 1⁄4 in) long, the male catkins pendulous, the female catkins erect"
Betula nigra, The fruit is unusual among birches in maturing in late spring; it is composed of numerous tiny winged seeds packed between the catkin bracts
Betula nigra,"


== Taxonomy ==
Betula nigra is a tree that falls into the family of Betulaceae, which is commonly known as the Birch or Alder Family"
Betula nigra," This family comprises six genera (Alnus, Betula, Carpinus, Corylus, Ostrya, and Ostryopsis) and includes alders, birches, hornbeams, and hazelnuts"
Betula nigra," Species within this family, along with Betula nigra, are shrubs or trees that grow along stream sides or in poorly drained soils throughout the Northern Hemisphere"

In states in which mining is prevalent, the river birch is often used for reclamation and erosion control, as it is well suited for soils that are too acidic for other species of hardwoods"
Betula nigra," In West Virginia, they have been found to establish within mine refuge sites after being blown from neighboring areas"
Betula nigra,"As the species occurs predominately in flood plains and along stream banks, it is described as being moderately tolerant of flooding"
Betula nigra, Saplings were observed to survive up to 30 days of continuous flooding in some regions
Betula nigra," While the species is tolerant of excessive water, it is intolerant of shade"
Betula nigra, Seeds will not germinate without a large amount of direct sunlight
Betula nigra,"


== Germination ==
Seeds are typically produced annually"
Betula nigra, Seasonal development begins in the fall as male catkins begin to form and mature
Betula nigra, The emergence of female catkins corresponds with the return of leaves around early spring
Betula nigra, Male and female fruit matures during the spring season or in the early summer months
Betula nigra,"Once mature, the seeds are predominantly spread by wind of water from neighboring stream channels"
Betula nigra,"  Seeds spread by water are generally more successful as the moist banks of stream channels, where the seeds are deposited, are favorable for germination and sturdy establishment"
Betula nigra," Successful germination often occurs in large numbers along sandbars, where alluvial soil is present"
Betula nigra,"


== Cultivation and uses ==
While its native habitat is wet ground, it will grow on higher land, and its bark is quite distinctive, making it a favored ornamental tree for landscape use"
Betula nigra," A number of cultivars with much whiter bark than the normal wild type have been selected for garden planting, including 'Heritage' and 'Dura Heat'; these are notable as the only white-barked birches resistant to the bronze birch borer Agrilus anxius in warm areas of the southeastern United States of America"
Betula nigra,"Native Americans used the boiled sap as a sweetener similar to maple syrup, and the inner bark as a survival food"
Betula nigra," The river birch is not typically used in the commercial lumber industry, due to knotting, but its strong, closely grained wood is sometimes used for local furniture, woodenware, and fuel"
Betula nigra," This species is utilized by many local bird species, such as waterfowl, ruffed grouse, and wild turkey"
Betula nigra," Many waterfowl use the cover for nesting sites, while the ruffed grouse and wild turkey use the seeds as a food source"

Paper mulberry,"The paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera, syn"
Paper mulberry, Morus papyrifera L
Paper mulberry,) is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae
Paper mulberry,"  It is native to Asia, where its range includes China, Japan, Korea, Indochina, Burma, and India"
Paper mulberry," It is widely cultivated elsewhere and it grows as an introduced species in parts of Europe, the United States, and Africa"
Paper mulberry, Other common names include tapa cloth tree
Paper mulberry,"


== Origin ==
Paper mulberry was used among ancient Austronesians in making barkcloth"
Paper mulberry," It originates from subtropical regions in mainland Asia and is one of the best examples for the mainstream ""Out of Taiwan"" hypothesis of the Austronesian expansion"
Paper mulberry, Various genetic studies have traced the origins of paper mulberry populations in the Remote Pacific all the way to Taiwan via New Guinea and Sulawesi
Paper mulberry," In the Philippines, which was along the expansion path, paper mulberries are mostly descendants of modern introductions in 1935"
Paper mulberry," Ancient introductions of paper mulberry presumably went extinct in prehistory due to their replacement with hand-woven fabrics, given that paper mulberry generally only survives under human cultivation"
Paper mulberry," However, its absence in the Philippines further underlines its origins in Taiwan, and not within island Southeast Asia"
Paper mulberry," Additionally, paper mulberry populations in New Guinea also show genetic inflow from another expansion out of Indochina and South China"
Paper mulberry,"It is believed to be the most widely transported fiber crop in prehistory, having been transported along with the full range of the Austronesian expansion, as opposed to most of the other commensal crops in Oceania"
Paper mulberry," Paper mulberry is present in almost every island or island group in Polynesia, including Rapa Nui and Aotearoa"
Paper mulberry," Some populations have gone recently extinct after they stopped being cultivated, such as in the Cook Islands and Mangareva, although accounts and prepared barkcloth and herbarium specimens of them exist in museum collections gathered by Europeans during the colonial era"
Paper mulberry, They were spread by Polynesians primarily through vegetative propagation with cuttings and root shoots
Paper mulberry," They were rarely cultivated from seeds, as most plants were harvested prior to flowering, when the stems reach around 1 in (2"
Paper mulberry,"5 cm) in diameter, as described by 18th-century European accounts"
Paper mulberry," If the feral plants reproduced sexually is unknown, as the plants are dioecious and require both male and female specimens to be present in one island"

=== Barkcloth ===

Paper mulberry is primarily used in the Pacific Islands to make barkcloth (tapa in most Polynesian languages)"
Paper mulberry," Barkcloth can also be made from other members of the mulberry family (Moraceae), including Ficus (figs) and Artocarpus"
Paper mulberry," Barkcloth was also occasionally made from Pipturus nettles, especially in Hawaii"
Paper mulberry," However, the highest quality of barkcloth was from paper mulberry"
Paper mulberry,"Barkcloth was mainly used for clothing among ancient Austronesians and is traditionally made using characteristic stone or wooden beaters, which are among the most common artifacts found in Austronesian archaeological sites"
Paper mulberry," Numerous archaeological remains of barkcloth beaters in southern China have been regarded as evidence that the pre-Taiwan Austronesian homelands were located in the region prior to the southward expansion of the Han Dynasty, particularly around the Pearl River Delta"
Paper mulberry," The oldest such remains are from the Dingmo Site in Guangxi, dated to around 7,900 BP"
Paper mulberry," Barkcloth remained an important source of clothing fabrics in pre-colonial Melanesia, Polynesia, and parts of Indonesia"
Paper mulberry," However, it has been mostly replaced by woven fiber clothing in most of Island Southeast Asia and Micronesia"
Paper mulberry, It is still worn ceremonially in parts of Polynesia and Melanesia
Paper mulberry, It is also used to make bags and bedding
Paper mulberry,"Although numerous names are used for paper mulberry throughout Austronesia, none are cognates, thus a Proto-Oceanic term cannot be reconstructed"
Paper mulberry," In most of Polynesia, the term for barkcloth can be reconstructed from Proto-Nuclear-Polynesian *taba, meaning ""bark"", with cognates including Wayan taba; Tongan, Samoan, Mangareva, and Rarotongan tapa; and Hawaiian kapa"
Paper mulberry," Other terms widely used for barkcloth and paper mulberry are derived from the Proto-Polynesian reconstructed word *siapo, with cognates including Niue, Tongan, and Marquesan hiapo; and Samoan and East Futunan siapo"
Paper mulberry," The term for barkcloth beater, however, can be reconstructed more extensively back to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *ike, with cognates including Uma ike; Sa'a iki; Bauan, Tongan, and East Futunan ike; and Samoan and Hawaiian iʻe"

== Life history ==


=== Reproduction and early growth ===


==== Flowering and fruiting ====
Mockernut hickory is monoecious - male and female flowers are produced on the same tree"
Carya tomentosa, Mockernut male flowers are catkins about 10 to 13 cm (3
Carya tomentosa,9 to 5
Carya tomentosa,1 in) long and may be produced on branches from axils of leaves of the previous season or from the inner scales of the terminal buds at the base of the current growth
Carya tomentosa, The female flowers appear in short spikes on peduncles terminating in shoots of the current year
Carya tomentosa," Flowers bloom in the spring from April to May, depending on latitude and weather"
Carya tomentosa, Usually the male flowers emerge before the female flowers
Carya tomentosa, Hickories produce very large amounts of pollen that is dispersed by the wind
Carya tomentosa,"
Fruits are solitary or paired and globose, ripening in September and October, and are about 2"
Carya tomentosa,5 to 9
Carya tomentosa,0 cm (0
Carya tomentosa,98 to 3
Carya tomentosa,54 in) long with a short necklike base
Carya tomentosa," The fruit has a thick, four-ribbed husk 3 to 4 mm (0"
Carya tomentosa,12 to 0
Carya tomentosa,16 in) thick that usually splits from the middle to the base
Carya tomentosa," The nut is distinctly four-angled with a reddish-brown, very hard shell 5 to 6 mm (0"
Carya tomentosa,20 to 0
Carya tomentosa,24 in) thick containing a small edible kernel
Carya tomentosa,"


==== Seed production and dissemination ====
The seed is dispersed from September through December"
Carya tomentosa, Mockernut hickory requires a minimum of 25 years to reach commercial seed-bearing age
Carya tomentosa," Optimum seed production occurs from 40 to 125 years, and the maximum age listed for commercial seed production is 200 years"
Carya tomentosa,"
Good seed crops occur every two to three years with light seed crops in intervening years"
Carya tomentosa, Around 50 to 75% of fresh seed will germinate
Carya tomentosa," Fourteen mockernut hickory trees in southeastern Ohio produced an average annual crop of 6,285 nuts for 6 years; about 39% were sound, 48% aborted, and 13% had insect damage"
Carya tomentosa, Hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana) is probably a major factor in reducing germination
Carya tomentosa,"
Mockernut hickory produces one of the heaviest seeds of the hickory species; cleaned seeds range from 70 to 250 seeds/kg (32 to 113/lb)"
Carya tomentosa," Seed is disseminated mainly by gravity and wildlife, particularly squirrels"
Carya tomentosa, Birds also help disperse seed
Carya tomentosa, Wildlife such as squirrels and chipmunks often bury the seed at some distance from the seed-bearing tree
Carya tomentosa,"


==== Seedling development ====
Hickory seeds show embryo dormancy that can be overcome by stratification in a moist medium at 1 to 4 °C (33° to 40 °F) for 30 to 150 days"
Carya tomentosa," When stored for a year or more, seed may require stratification for only 30 to 60 days"
Carya tomentosa, Hickory nuts seldom remain viable in the ground for more than I year
Carya tomentosa," Hickory species normally require a moderately moist seedbed for satisfactory seed germination, and mockernut hickory seems to reproduce best in moist duff"
Carya tomentosa, Germination is hypogeal
Carya tomentosa,"
Mockernut seedlings are not fast-growing"
Carya tomentosa," The height growth of mockernut seedlings observed in the Ohio Valley in the open or under light shade on red clay soil was:


==== Vegetative reproduction ====
True hickories sprout prolifically from stumps after cutting and fire"
Carya tomentosa," As the stumps increase in size, the number of stumps that produce sprouts decreases; age is probably directly correlated to stump size and sprouting"
Carya tomentosa, Coppice management is a possibility with true hickories
Carya tomentosa, True hickories are difficult to reproduce from cuttings
Carya tomentosa," Madden discussed the techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation wood"
Carya tomentosa, Reed indicated that the most tested hickory species for root stock for pecan hickory grafts were mockernut and water hickory (Carya aquatica)
Carya tomentosa,"
However, mockernut root stock grew slowly and reduced the growth of pecan tops"
Carya tomentosa," Also, this graft seldom produced a tree that bore well or yielded large nuts"
Carya tomentosa,"


=== Sapling and pole stages to maturity ===


==== Growth and yield ====
Mockernut hickory is a large, true hickory with a dense crown"
Carya tomentosa," This species occasionally grows to about 30 m (98 ft) tall and 91 cm (36 in) in diameter at breast height (dbh), but heights and diameters usually range from about 15 and 46 to 61 cm (5"
Carya tomentosa,9 and 18
Carya tomentosa,1 to 24
Carya tomentosa,"0 in), respectively"
Carya tomentosa,"
The relation of height to age is:

The current annual growth of mockernut hickory on dry sites is estimated at about 1"
Carya tomentosa,0 m³/ha (15 ft³/acre)
Carya tomentosa, In fully stocked stands on moderately fertile soil2
Carya tomentosa,"1 m³ /ha (30 ft³ /acre) is estimated, though annual growth rates of 3"
Carya tomentosa,1 m³/ha (44 ft³/acre) were reported in Ohio (26)
Carya tomentosa, Greenwood and bark weights for commercial-size mockernut trees from mixed hardwoods in Georgia are available for total tree and saw-log stems to a 4-inch top for trees 5 to 22 inches d
Carya tomentosa,b
Carya tomentosa,h
Carya tomentosa,
Carya tomentosa,"
Available growth data and other research information are summarized for hickory species, not for individual species"
Carya tomentosa," Trimble compared growth rates of various Appalachian hardwoods including a hickory species category dominant-codominant hickory trees 38 to 51 cm (15 to 20 in) in dbh on good oak sites grew slowly compared to northern red oak, yellow-poplar, black cherry (Prunus serotina), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum)"
Carya tomentosa," Hickories were in the white oak, sweet birch (Betula lenta), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) growth-rate category"
Carya tomentosa, Dominant-codominant hickory trees grew about 3 mm (0
Carya tomentosa,12 in) dbh per year compared to 5 mm (0
Carya tomentosa,20 in) for the moderate-growth species (black cherry) and 6 mm (0
Carya tomentosa,24 in) for the faster-growing species (yellow-poplar and red oak)
Carya tomentosa, Equations are available for predicting merchantable gross volumes from hickory stump diameters in Ohio
Carya tomentosa," Also, procedures are described for predicting diameters and heights and for developing volume tables to any merchantable top diameter for hickory species in southern Illinois and West Virginia"
Carya tomentosa," Generally, epicormic branching is not a problem with hickory species, but a few branches do occur"
Carya tomentosa,"


==== Rooting habit ====
True hickories such as mockernut develop a long taproot with few laterals"
Carya tomentosa," Early root growth is primarily into the taproot, which typically reaches a depth of 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in) during the first year"
Carya tomentosa," Small laterals originate along the taproot, but many die back during the fall"
Carya tomentosa," During the second year, the taproot may reach a depth of 122 cm (48 in), and the laterals grow rapidly"
Carya tomentosa," After 5 years, the root system attains its maximum depth, and the horizontal spread of the roots is about double that of the crown"
Carya tomentosa," By age 10, the height is four times the depth of the taproot"
Carya tomentosa,"


==== Reaction to competition ====
At certain times during its life, mockernut hickory may be variously classified as tolerant to intolerant"
Carya tomentosa, Overall it is classified as intolerant of shade
Carya tomentosa, It recovers rapidly from suppression and is probably a climax species on moist sites
Carya tomentosa,"
Silvicultural practices for managing the oak-hickory type have been summarized"
Carya tomentosa, Establishing the seedling origin of hickory trees is difficult because of seed predators
Carya tomentosa," Although infrequent bumper seed crops usually provide some seedlings, seedling survival is poor under a dense canopy"
Carya tomentosa," Because of prolific sprouting ability, hickory reproduction can survive browsing, breakage, drought, and fire"
Carya tomentosa," Top dieback and resprouting may occur several times, each successive shoot reaching a larger size and developing a stronger root system than its predecessors"
Carya tomentosa," By this process, hickory reproduction gradually accumulates and grows under moderately dense canopies, especially on sites dry enough to restrict reproduction of more tolerant, but more fire or drought-sensitive species"
Carya tomentosa,"
Wherever adequate hickory advance reproduction occurs, clearcutting results in new sapling stands containing some hickories"
Carya tomentosa," Reproduction is difficult to attain if advance hickory regeneration is inadequate, though; then clearcutting will eliminate hickories except for stump sprouts"
Carya tomentosa," In theory, light thinnings or shelterwood cuts can be used to create advance hickory regeneration, but this has not been demonstrated"
Carya tomentosa,"


==== Damaging agents ====
Mockernut hickory is extremely sensitive to fire because of the low insulating capacity of the hard, flinty bark"
Carya tomentosa, It is not subject to severe loss from disease
Carya tomentosa," The main fungus of hickory is Poria spiculosa, a trunk rot"
Carya tomentosa," This fungus kills the bark, which produces a canker, causes heart rot and decay, and can seriously degrade the tree"
Carya tomentosa, Mineral streaks and sapsucker-induced streaks also degrade the lumber
Carya tomentosa," In general, the hard, strong, and durable wood of hickories makes them relatively resistant to decay fungi"
Carya tomentosa," Most fungi cause little, if any, decay in small, young trees"
Carya tomentosa,"
Common foliage diseases include leaf mildew and witches' broom (Microstroma juglandis), leaf blotch (Mycosphaerella dendroides), and pecan scab (Cladosporium effusum)"
Carya tomentosa, Mockernut hickory is host to anthracnose (Gnomonia caryae)
Carya tomentosa,"
Nuts of all hickory species are susceptible to attack by the hickory nut weevil (Curculio caryae)"
Carya tomentosa, Another weevil (Conotrachelus aratus) attacks young shoots and leaf petioles
Carya tomentosa, The Curculio species are the most damaging and can destroy 65% of the hickory nut crop
Carya tomentosa, Hickory shuckworms also damage nuts
Carya tomentosa,"
The bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) attacks mockernut hickory, especially in drought years and where hickory species are growing rapidly"
Carya tomentosa, The hickory spiral borer (Argilus arcuatus torquatus) and the pecan carpenterworm (Cossula magnifica) are also serious insect enemies of mockernut
Carya tomentosa, The hickory bark beetle probably destroys more sawtimber-size mockernut trees than any other insect
Carya tomentosa," The hickory spiral borer kills many seedlings and young trees, and the pecan carpenterworm degrades both trees and logs"
Carya tomentosa, The twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) attacks both small and large trees; it seriously deforms trees by sawing branches
Carya tomentosa," Sometimes, these girdlers cut hickory seedlings near ground level"
Carya tomentosa,"
Two casebearers (Acrobasis caryivorella and A"
Carya tomentosa," juglandis) feed on buds and leaves; later, they bore into succulent hickory shoots"
Carya tomentosa, Larvae of A
Carya tomentosa, caryivorella may destroy entire nut sets
Carya tomentosa, The living-hickory borer (Goes pulcher) feeds on hickory boles and branches throughout the East
Carya tomentosa," Borers commonly found on dying or dead hickory trees or cut logs include:

Banded hickory borer (Knulliana cincta)
Long-horned beetle (Saperda discoidea)
Apple twig borer (Amphicerus bicaudatus)
Flatheaded ambrosia beetle (Platypus compositus)
Redheaded ash borer (Neoclytus acuminatus)
False powderpost beetle (Scobicia bidentata)Severe damage to hickory lumber and manufactured hickory products is caused by powderpost beetles (Lyctus spp"
Carya tomentosa, and Polycanon stoutii)
Carya tomentosa, Gall insects (Caryomyia spp
Carya tomentosa,) commonly infest leaves
Carya tomentosa, The fruit-tree leafroller (Archips argyrospila) and the hickory leafroller (Argyrotaenia juglandana) are the most common leaf feeders
Carya tomentosa, The giant bark aphid (Longistigma caryae) is common on hickory bark
Carya tomentosa, This aphid usually feeds on twigs and can cause branch mortality
Carya tomentosa, The European fruit lecanium (Parthnolecanium corni) is common on hickories
Carya tomentosa,"
Mockernut is not easily injured by ice glaze or snow, but young seedlings are very susceptible to frost damage"
Carya tomentosa, Many birds and animals feed on the nuts of mockernut hickory
Carya tomentosa," This feeding combined with insect and disease problems eliminates the annual nut production, except during bumper seed crop years"
Carya tomentosa,"


== Special uses ==
Mockernuts are preferred mast for wildlife, particularly squirrels, which eat green nuts"
Carya tomentosa," Black bears, foxes, rabbits, beavers, and white-footed mice feed on the nuts, and sometimes the bark"
Carya tomentosa, The white-tailed deer browse on foliage and twigs and also feed on nuts
Carya tomentosa," Hickory nuts are a minor source of food for ducks, quail, and turkey"
Carya tomentosa,"
Mockernut hickory nuts are consumed by many species of birds and other animals, including wood duck, red-bellied woodpecker, red fox, squirrels, beaver, eastern cottontail, eastern chipmunk, turkey, white-tailed deer, white-footed mice, and others"
Carya tomentosa, Many insect pests eat hickory leaves and bark
Carya tomentosa," Mockernut hickories also provide cavities for animals to live in, such as woodpeckers, black rat snakes, raccoons, Carolina chickadees, and more"
Carya tomentosa," They are also good nesting trees, providing cover for birds with their thick foliage"
Carya tomentosa, Animals help disperse seeds so that new hickories can grow elsewhere
Carya tomentosa," Chipmunks, squirrels, and birds do this best"
Carya tomentosa," Some fungi grow on mockernut hickory roots, sharing nutrients from the soil"
Carya tomentosa,True hickories provide a large portion of the high-grade hickory used by industry
Carya tomentosa," Mockernut is used for lumber, pulpwood, charcoal, and other fuelwood products"
Carya tomentosa, Hickory species are preferred species for fuelwood consumption
Carya tomentosa, Mockernut has the second-highest heating value among the species of hickories
Carya tomentosa," It can be used for veneer, but the low supply of logs of veneer quality is a limiting factor"
Carya tomentosa,"
Mockernut hickory is used for tool handles requiring high shock resistance"
Carya tomentosa," It is used for ladder rungs, athletic goods, agricultural implements, dowels, gymnasium apparatus, poles, shafts, well pumps, and furniture"
Carya tomentosa," Lower-grade lumber is used for pallets, blocking, etc"
Carya tomentosa," Hickory sawdust, chips, and some solid wood are often used by packing companies to smoke meats; mockernut is the preferred wood for smoking hams"
Carya tomentosa," Though mockernut kernels are edible, they are rarely eaten by humans because of their size and because they are eaten by squirrels and other wildlife"
Carya tomentosa,"


== Genetics ==
Mockernut is a 64-chromosome species, so rarely crosses with 32-chromosome species such as pecan or shellbark hickory"
Carya tomentosa, No published information exists concerning population or other genetic studies of this species
Carya tomentosa,  Efforts are currently underway to map the genome of pecan in a collaborative effort
Carya tomentosa,  The genome map at some point may expand to cover other hickory species
Carya tomentosa,"
Hickories are noted for their variability, with many natural hybrids known among North American Carya species"
Carya tomentosa, Hickories usually can be crossed successfully within the genus
Carya tomentosa, Geneticists recognize that mockernut hickory hybridizes naturally with C
Carya tomentosa, illinoensis (Carya x schneckii Sarg
Carya tomentosa,) and C
Carya tomentosa, ovata (Carya x collina Laughlin)
Carya tomentosa,  Mockernut readily hybridizes with tetraploid C
Carya tomentosa, texana
Carya tomentosa,  Hybrids generally are shy nut producers or produce nuts that are not filled with a kernel
Carya tomentosa,  Numerous exceptions to this rule are known

Carya tomentosa,
Castanea dentata,"The American chestnut (Castanea dentata) is a large, monoecious deciduous tree of the beech family native to eastern North America"
Castanea dentata," Before the species was devastated by the chestnut blight, a fungal disease, it was one of the most important forest trees throughout its range, and was considered the finest chestnut tree in the world"
Castanea dentata, It is estimated that between 3 and 4 billion American chestnut trees were destroyed in the first half of the 20th century by blight after its initial discovery in 1904
Castanea dentata," Very few mature specimens of the tree exist within its historical range, although many small shoots of the former live trees remain"
Castanea dentata," There are hundreds of large (2 to 5 ft diameter) American chestnuts outside its historical range, some in areas where less virulent strains of the pathogen are more common, such as the 600 to 800 large trees in northern Lower Michigan"
Castanea dentata, The species is listed as endangered in Canada as well as in the United States
Castanea dentata,"


== Description ==

Castanea dentata is a rapidly growing deciduous hardwood tree, historically reaching up to 30 metres (98 ft) in height, and 3 metres (9"
Castanea dentata,8 ft) in diameter
Castanea dentata," It ranged from Maine and southern Ontario to Mississippi, and from the Atlantic coast to the Appalachian Mountains and the Ohio Valley"
Castanea dentata, C
Castanea dentata, dentata was once one of the most common trees in the Northeastern United States
Castanea dentata," In Pennsylvania alone, it is estimated to have comprised 25–30% of all hardwoods"
Castanea dentata, The tree's huge population was due to a combination of rapid growth and a large annual seed crop in comparison to oaks which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year
Castanea dentata, Nut production begins when C
Castanea dentata, dentata is 7–8 years old
Castanea dentata,"
There are several similar chestnut species, such as the European sweet chestnut, Chinese chestnut, and Japanese chestnut"
Castanea dentata," The American species can be distinguished by a few morphological traits, such as leaf shape, petiole length and nut size"
Castanea dentata," For example, it has larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name dentata, Latin for ""toothed"""
Castanea dentata," According to a 1999 study by American Society for Horticultural Science, the Ozark chinkapin, which is typically considered either a distinct species (C"
Castanea dentata, ozarkensis) or a subspecies of the Allegheny chinkapin (C
Castanea dentata, pumila ozarkensis) may be ancestral to both the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinkapin
Castanea dentata,"The leaves, which are 14–20 cm (5"
Castanea dentata,"5–8 in) long and 7–10 cm (3–4 in) broad, also tend to average slightly shorter and broader than those of the sweet chestnut"
Castanea dentata," The blight-resistant Chinese chestnut is now the most commonly planted chestnut species in the US, while the European chestnut is the source of commercial nuts in recent decades"
Castanea dentata, It can be distinguished from the American chestnut by its hairy twig tips which are in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut
Castanea dentata," The chestnuts are in the beech family along with beech and oak, but are not closely related to the horse-chestnut, which is in the family Sapindaceae"
Castanea dentata,"
The chestnut is monoecious, producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long catkins"
Castanea dentata, The female parts are found near base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer
Castanea dentata," Like all members of the Fagaceae family, American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be any member of the Castanea genus"
Castanea dentata,"
The American chestnut is a prolific bearer of nuts, usually with three nuts enclosed in each spiny, green burr, and lined in tan velvet"
Castanea dentata," The nuts develop through late summer, with the burrs opening and falling to the ground near the first fall frost"
Castanea dentata,"
The American chestnut was a very important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall mast for species such as white-tailed deer and wild turkey and, formerly, the passenger pigeon"
Castanea dentata, Black bears were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter
Castanea dentata," The American chestnut also contains more nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium in its leaves when compared to other trees that share its habitat"
Castanea dentata," This means they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and microorganisms"
Castanea dentata,"


== Chestnut blight ==

Once an important hardwood timber tree, the American chestnut suffered a substantial population collapse due to the chestnut blight, a disease caused by an Asian bark fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica, formerly Endothia parasitica)"
Castanea dentata, This disease was accidentally introduced into North America on imported Asiatic chestnut trees
Castanea dentata," Chestnut blight was first noticed on American chestnut trees in what was then the New York Zoological Park, now known as the Bronx Zoo, in the borough of The Bronx, New York City, in 1904, by chief forester Hermann Merkel"
Castanea dentata, Merkel estimated that by 1906 blight had infected 98 percent of the chestnut trees in the borough
Castanea dentata," While Chinese chestnut evolved with the blight and developed a strong resistance, the American chestnut had little resistance"
Castanea dentata, The airborne bark fungus spread 50 mi (80 km) a year and in a few decades girdled and killed up to three billion American chestnut trees
Castanea dentata, Salvage logging during the early years of the blight may have unwittingly destroyed trees which had high levels of resistance to this disease and thus aggravated the calamity
Castanea dentata," New shoots often sprout from the roots when the main stem dies, so the species has not yet become extinct"
Castanea dentata," However, the stump sprouts rarely reach more than 6 m (20 ft) in height before blight infection returns"
Castanea dentata,"
Prior to chestnut blight occurring, an epidemic of ink disease struck American chestnuts in the early 19th century"
Castanea dentata," This pathogen, apparently introduced from Europe, where it affects C"
Castanea dentata," sativa, kills the tree's roots and collars"
Castanea dentata," It affected primarily chestnuts in the Southeastern US and at the time when chestnut blight struck, the range of C"
Castanea dentata, dentata may have already been reduced
Castanea dentata,"


=== Reduced population ===
The total number of chestnut trees in eastern North America was estimated at over three billion, and 25% of the trees in the Appalachian Mountains were American chestnut"
Castanea dentata, The number of large surviving trees over 60 cm (24 in) in diameter within its former range is probably fewer than 100
Castanea dentata, American chestnuts were also common part of the forest canopy in southeast Michigan
Castanea dentata,"Although large trees are currently rare east of the Mississippi River, it exists in pockets in the blight-free West, where the habitat was agreeable for planting: settlers took seeds for American chestnut with them in the 19th century"
Castanea dentata," Huge planted chestnut trees can be found in Sherwood, Oregon, as the Mediterranean climate of the West Coast discourages the fungus, which relies on hot, humid summer weather"
Castanea dentata,"  American chestnut also thrives as far north as Revelstoke, British Columbia"
Castanea dentata,"At present, it is believed that survival of C"
Castanea dentata, dentata for more than a decade in its native range is almost impossible
Castanea dentata,"  The fungus uses various oak trees as a host, and while the oak itself is unaffected, American chestnuts nearby will succumb to the blight in approximately a year or more"
Castanea dentata," In addition, the hundreds of chestnut stumps and ""living stools"" dotting eastern woodlands may still contain active pathogens"
Castanea dentata,"


== Attempts at revitalization ==
Several organizations are attempting to breed blight-resistant chestnut trees"
Castanea dentata," The American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation breeds surviving American chestnuts, which have shown some native resistance to blight, and the Canadian Chestnut Council is attempting to reintroduce the trees in Canada, primarily in Ontario"
Castanea dentata, A technique called backcrossing is being used by The American Chestnut Foundation in an attempt to restore the American chestnut to its original habitat
Castanea dentata,"


=== Intercrossing surviving American chestnuts ===

American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation (ACCF) is not using Oriental genes for blight resistance, but intercrossing among American chestnuts selected for native resistance to the blight, a breeding strategy described by the ACCF as ""All-American intercrosses"""
Castanea dentata," John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and professor emeritus of chemistry at Concord University, and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at Virginia Tech, think there may be several different characteristics which favor blight resistance"
Castanea dentata, Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut
Castanea dentata,"  They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest"
Castanea dentata," Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years, developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically"
Castanea dentata, He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers
Castanea dentata," Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood"
Castanea dentata," Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers"
Castanea dentata, The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers
Castanea dentata," Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980"
Castanea dentata," The first ""All-American intercrosses"" were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in Giles County, Virginia, and in Beckley, West Virginia"
Castanea dentata, They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992
Castanea dentata," Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test"
Castanea dentata," Many ACCF chestnuts have expressed blight resistance equal to or greater than an original blight survivor but so far, only a handful have demonstrated superior, durable blight control"
Castanea dentata, Time will tell if the progeny of these best chestnuts exhibit durable blight resistance in different stress environments
Castanea dentata,"


=== Backcrossing ===
Backcrossing as a treatment for blight was first proposed by Charles R"
Castanea dentata, Burnham of the University of Minnesota in the 1970s
Castanea dentata," Burnham, a professor emeritus in agronomy and plant genetics who was considered one of the pioneers of maize genetics, realized that experiments conducted by the USDA to cross-breed American chestnuts with European and Asian chestnuts erroneously assumed that a large number of genes were responsible for blight resistance, while it is currently believed the number of responsible genes is low"
Castanea dentata, The USDA abandoned their cross-breeding program and destroyed local plantings around 1960 after failing to produce a blight-resistant hybrid
Castanea dentata," Burnham's recognition of the USDA's error led to him joining with others to create The American Chestnut Foundation in 1983, with the sole purpose of breeding a blight-resistant American chestnut"
Castanea dentata," The American Chestnut Foundation is backcrossing blight-resistant Chinese chestnut into American chestnut trees, to recover the American growth characteristics and genetic makeup, and then finally intercrossing the advanced backcross generations to eliminate genes for susceptibility to blight"
Castanea dentata," The first backcrossed American chestnut tree, called ""Clapper"", survived blight for 25 years, and grafts of the tree have been used by The American Chestnut Foundation since 1983"
Castanea dentata," The Pennsylvania chapter of The American Chestnut Foundation, which seeks to restore the American chestnut to the forests of the Mid-Atlantic states, has planted over 22,000 trees"
Castanea dentata,The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 requires owners of abandoned coal mines to cover at least 80 percent of their land with vegetation
Castanea dentata," While many companies planted invasive grasses, others began funding research on planting trees, because they can be more cost-effective, and yield better results"
Castanea dentata," Keith Gilland began planting American chestnut trees in old strip mines in 2008 as a student at Miami University, and to date has planted over 5,000 trees"
Castanea dentata," In 2005, a hybrid tree with mostly American genes was planted on the lawn of the White House"
Castanea dentata,  A tree planted in 2005 in the tree library outside the USDA building was still very healthy seven years later; it contains 98% American chestnut DNA and 2% Chinese chestnut DNA
Castanea dentata, This tree contains enough Chinese chestnut DNA that encodes for systemic resistance genes to resist the blight
Castanea dentata, This is essential for restoring the American chestnut trees into the Northeast
Castanea dentata, The Northern Nut Growers Association (NNGA) has also been active in pursuing viable hybrids
Castanea dentata," From 1962 to 1990, Alfred Szego and other members of the NNGA developed hybrids with Chinese varieties which showed limited resistance"
Castanea dentata,"


=== Transgenic blight-resistant American chestnut ===
Researchers at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF), have developed partially blight-resistant transgenic American chestnuts that are capable of surviving infection by Cryphonectria parasitica"
Castanea dentata," This was done by inserting a specific gene from wheat, oxalate oxidase, into the American chestnut genome"
Castanea dentata," The oxalate oxidase enzyme is an extremely common fungal defense in plants, and is found in strawberries, bananas, oats, barley, and other cereals"
Castanea dentata, Oxalate oxidase breaks down the oxalic acid which the fungus secretes in the cambium to lower the pH and subsequently kill plant tissues
Castanea dentata," The chestnut trees which contain this resistance gene can be infected by the chestnut blight, but the tree is not girdled by the resulting canker and heals around the wound"
Castanea dentata, This lets the fungus fulfill its normal lifecycle without the death of the tree
Castanea dentata, The blight resistance gene is passed down to the tree's offspring to provide subsequent generations with partial blight resistance
Castanea dentata," In 2015, the researchers are working towards applying for government permission to make these trees available to the public in the next five years"
Castanea dentata, These trees could be the first genetically modified forest trees released in the wild in the United States
Castanea dentata,"


=== Hypovirulence ===
Hypovirus is the only genus in the family Hypoviridae"
Castanea dentata, Members of this genus infect fungal pathogens and reduce their ability to cause disease (hypovirulence)
Castanea dentata," In particular, the virus infects Cryphonectria parasitica, the fungus that causes chestnut blight, which has enabled infected trees to recover from the blight"
Castanea dentata, The use of hypovirulence to control blight originated in Europe where the fungal virus spread naturally through populations of European chestnuts
Castanea dentata," The reduced ability of the fungus to cause disease allowed the European chestnut to regenerate, creating large stands of trees"
Castanea dentata," Hypovirulence has also been found in North America, but has not spread effectively"
Castanea dentata," The ""Arner Tree"" of Southern Ontario, is one of the best examples of naturally occurring hypovirulence"
Castanea dentata, It is a mature American chestnut that has recovered from severe infections of chestnut blight
Castanea dentata, The cankers have healed over and the tree continues to grow vigorously
Castanea dentata," Scientists have discovered that the chestnut blight remaining on the tree is hypovirulent, although isolates taken from the tree do not have the fungal viruses found in other isolates"
Castanea dentata, Trees inoculated with isolates taken from the Arner tree have shown moderate canker control
Castanea dentata,"


== Surviving specimens ==

About 2,500 chestnut trees are growing on 60 acres near West Salem, Wisconsin, which is the world's largest remaining stand of American chestnut"
Castanea dentata," These trees are the descendants of those planted by Martin Hicks, an early settler in the area, who planted fewer than a dozen trees in the late 1800's"
Castanea dentata," Planted outside the natural range of chestnut, these trees escaped the initial onslaught of chestnut blight, but in 1987, scientists found blight in the stand"
Castanea dentata, Scientists are working to try to save the trees
Castanea dentata,"
Two of the largest surviving American chestnut trees are in Jackson County, Tennessee"
Castanea dentata," One, the state champion, has a diameter of 61 cm (24 in) and a height of 23 m (75 ft), and the other tree is nearly as large"
Castanea dentata, One of them has been pollinated with hybrid pollen by members of The American Chestnut Foundation; the progeny will have mostly American chestnut genes and some will be blight resistant

== Uses ==


=== Food and medicine ===

The nuts were once an important economic resource in North America, being sold on the streets of towns and cities, as they sometimes still are during the Christmas season (usually said to be ""roasting on an open fire"" because their smell is readily identifiable many blocks away)"
Castanea dentata," Chestnuts are edible raw or roasted, though typically preferred roasted"
Castanea dentata, Nuts of the European sweet chestnut are now sold instead in many stores
Castanea dentata, One must peel the brown skin to access the yellowish-white edible portion
Castanea dentata, The unrelated horse-chestnut's seeds are poisonous without extensive preparation
Castanea dentata," Native Americans used various parts of the American chestnut to treat ailments such as whooping cough, heart conditions and chafed skin"
Castanea dentata,"


=== Furniture and other wood products ===
The January 1888 issue of Orchard and Garden mentions the American chestnut as being ""superior in quality to any found in Europe"""
Castanea dentata," The wood is straight-grained, strong, and easy to saw and split, and it lacks the radial end grain found on most other hardwoods"
Castanea dentata, The tree was particularly valuable commercially since it grew at a faster rate than oaks
Castanea dentata," Being rich in tannins, the wood was highly resistant to decay and therefore used for a variety of purposes, including furniture, split-rail fences, shingles, home construction, flooring, piers, plywood, paper pulp, and telephone poles"
Castanea dentata, Tannins were also extracted from the bark for tanning leather
Castanea dentata," Although larger trees are no longer available for milling, much chestnut wood has been reclaimed from historic barns to be refashioned into furniture and other items"
Castanea dentata,"""Wormy"" chestnut refers to a defective grade of wood that has insect damage, having been sawn from long-dead, blight-killed trees"
Castanea dentata," This ""wormy"" wood has since become fashionable for its rustic character"
Castanea dentata, The American chestnut is not considered a particularly good patio shade tree because its droppings are prolific and a considerable nuisance
Castanea dentata," Catkins in the spring, spiny nut pods in the fall, and leaves in the early winter can all be a problem"
Castanea dentata," These characteristics are more or less common to all shade trees, but perhaps not to the same degree as with the chestnut"
Castanea dentata, The spiny seed pods are a particular nuisance when scattered over an area frequented by people
Castanea dentata,"

Catalpa speciosa,"Catalpa speciosa, commonly known as the northern catalpa, hardy catalpa, western catalpa, cigar tree, catawba-tree,
or bois chavanon, is a species of Catalpa native to the midwestern United States"
Catalpa speciosa,"
The Latin specific epithet speciosa means “showy”"
Catalpa speciosa,"


== Description ==
It is a medium-sized, deciduous tree growing to 15–30 meters tall and 12 meters wide"
Catalpa speciosa," It has a trunk up to 1 m diameter, with brown to gray bark maturing into hard plates or ridges"
Catalpa speciosa,"
The leaves are deciduous, opposite (or whorled), large, heart shaped, 20–30 cm long and 15–20 cm broad, pointed at the tip and softly hairy beneath"
Catalpa speciosa," The leaves generally do not color in autumn before falling, instead, they either fall abruptly after the first hard freeze, or turn a slightly yellow-brown before dropping off"
Catalpa speciosa, The catalpa tree is the last tree to grow leaves in the spring
Catalpa speciosa," The winter twigs of northern catalpa are like those of few other trees, having sunken leaf scars that resemble suction cups"
Catalpa speciosa, Their whorled arrangement (three scars per node) around the twigs is another diagnostic
Catalpa speciosa,"
The flowers are 3–6 cm across, trumpet shaped, white with yellow stripes and purple spots inside; they grow in panicles of 10-30"
Catalpa speciosa,"
The fruit is a long, thin legume-like capsule, 20–40 cm long and 10–12 mm diameter; it often stays attached to tree during winter (and can be mistaken for brown icicles)"
Catalpa speciosa," The pod contains numerous flat, light brown seeds with two papery wings"
Catalpa speciosa,"
It is closely related to southern catalpa, and can be distinguished by the flowering panicles, which bear a smaller number of larger flowers, and the slightly broader seed pods"
Catalpa speciosa,"


== Distribution ==
Catalpa speciosa was originally thought to be native only to a small area of the midwestern United States near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers"
Catalpa speciosa," However, in 1976, investigation of an  archeological site of an island in West Virginia's portion of the Ohio River revealed Catalpa speciosa to be present on the island around the period of 1500-1700 CE"
Catalpa speciosa, This suggests that Catalpa speciosa may have experienced a decline in range before European settlement
Catalpa speciosa," Today, its range has widely expanded east of the Rocky Mountains outside of its restricted pre-settlement location, further obscuring its true native range"
Catalpa speciosa,"


== Cultivation and uses ==
It is widely planted as an ornamental tree"
Catalpa speciosa," It is adapted to moist, high pH soil and full sun, but has been able to grow almost anywhere in North America"
Catalpa speciosa, In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017)
Catalpa speciosa,"The wood is soft, like white pine, and light, weighing only 26 pounds per cubic foot when dry"
Catalpa speciosa, It also does not rot easily; in earlier years it was used for fence posts and less than successfully as railroad ties
Catalpa speciosa," More modern uses that highlight the wood's beautiful grain include furniture, interior trim and cabinetry"
Catalpa speciosa, Catalpa has one of the lowest shrinkage/expansion rates of any U
Catalpa speciosa,S
Catalpa speciosa, hardwood
Catalpa speciosa," Only northern white cedar and redwood have lower shrinkage/expansion rates, and not by much"
Catalpa speciosa, The wood's unique properties make it excellent for carving and boat-building
Catalpa speciosa," Often regarded as a weed tree, its wood is under-appreciated and underused"
Catalpa speciosa, The tree's tendency to grow crooked does not help its reputation as a source of usable lumber
Catalpa speciosa,"
Northern catalpa has been extensively cultivated in Ohio for over 200 years, and is now naturalized in urban and rural areas"
Catalpa speciosa, Farmers introduced the rapidly growing northern catalpa to Ohio to produce large amounts of timber for fenceposts
Catalpa speciosa,"
Three liabilities exist in urban areas where it is found as both a shade and an ornamental tree"
Catalpa speciosa," Northern catalpa rains down fragments of its long fruits and fringed seeds from winter through spring, creating a cleanup chore"
Catalpa speciosa," In addition, it often gets far too big for its allocated space in the landscape, and crowds out or casts too much shade on other desirable plants"
Catalpa speciosa," Finally, its brittle wood, coupled with tree height, makes its branches at times subject to wind or ice damage"
Catalpa speciosa,"
The tree is often sought out by fishing enthusiasts, not for the plant itself, but for a common parasite that is used as bait"
Catalpa speciosa," The catalpa moth caterpillar, Ceratomia catalpae, is widely regarded as one of the best live baits, and the tree may be planted strictly for this purpose, and has earned the tree common names of worm tree, or bait tree"
Catalpa speciosa,"


== Diseases ==
Although northern catalpa can have several diseases and pests, most are usually minor and pose no serious threat"
Catalpa speciosa," The exception is the caterpillar of Ceratomia catalpae, which can on occasion defoliate the tree"

Cornus florida," 
Flowering dogwood demonstrates gametophytic self-incompatibility, meaning that the plants can't self-fertilize"
Cornus florida, This is important for breeding programs as it means that it is not necessary to emasculate (remove the anthers from) C
Cornus florida, florida flowers before making controlled cross-pollinations
Cornus florida," These pollinations should be repeated every other day, as the flowers must be cross-pollinated within one or two days of opening for pollinations to be effective"
Cornus florida,"

Softwood cuttings taken in late spring or early summer from new growth can be rooted under mist if treated with 8,000 to 10,000 ppm indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)"
Cornus florida," In cold climates, potted cuttings must be kept in heated cold frames or polyhouses the following winter to maintain temperatures between 0 and 7 °C (32 and 45 °F)"
Cornus florida," Although rooting success can be as high as 50–85%, this technique is not commonly used by commercial growers"
Cornus florida," Rather, selected cultivars are generally propagated by T-budding in late summer or by whip grafting in the greenhouse in winter onto seedling rootstock"
Cornus florida,Micropropagation of flowering dogwood is now used in breeding programs aiming to incorporate resistance to dogwood anthracnose and powdery mildew into horticulturally and economically important cultivars
Cornus florida, Nodal (axillary bud) sections are established in a culture of Woody Plant Medium (WPM) amended with 4
Cornus florida,4 µmol/L 6-Benzyladenine (BA) to promote shoot growth

Crataegus laevigata," In 1775 Jacquin formally separated the common hawthorn, naming it C monogyna, and in 1946 Dandy showed that Linnaeus had actually observed a different plant, and this would be C"
Crataegus laevigata, oxyacantha
Crataegus laevigata," However, by this time confusion over the true identity of C oxyacantha was so great that Byatt proposed that the name should be formally rejected as ambiguous, and this proposal was accepted by the International Botanical Congress, although the name continues to be used informally"
Crataegus laevigata,"
The midland hawthorn was described botanically as a separate species as long ago as 1798 by Poiret, whose name Mespilus laevigata referred to this hawthorn"

Diospyros virginiana,"In respect to the power of making heartwood, the persimmon rarely develops any heartwood until it is nearly one hundred years old"
Diospyros virginiana,"  This heartwood is extremely close-grained and almost black, resembling ebony (of which it is a true variety)"
Diospyros virginiana,"It is a common misconception persimmon fruit needs frost to ripen and soften, called bletting"
Diospyros virginiana," Some, such as the early-ripening varieties ""pieper"" and ""NC21""(also known as ""supersweet""), easily lose astringency and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touch—these are then very sweet, even in the British climate"
Diospyros virginiana," On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited ""yates"", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate)"
Diospyros virginiana," Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen"
Diospyros virginiana, Only completely ripe and soft fruit can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception)
Diospyros virginiana," The same goes for the Oriental persimmon (Diospyros kaki), where early frost can severely damage a fruit crop"

Eucommia ulmoides,"


== Description ==
Eucommia ulmoides grows to about 15 m tall"
Eucommia ulmoides," The leaves are deciduous, arranged alternately, simple ovate with an acuminate tip, 8–16 cm long, and with a serrated margin"
Eucommia ulmoides," If a leaf is torn across, strands of latex exuded from the leaf veins solidify into rubber and hold the two parts of the leaf together"
Eucommia ulmoides, It flowers from March to May
Eucommia ulmoides," The flowers are inconspicuous, small and greenish; the fruit, June to November, is a winged samara with one seed, very similar to an elm samara in appearance, 2–3 cm long and 1–2 cm broad"
Eucommia ulmoides,"


== Taxonomy ==
E"
Eucommia ulmoides, ulmoides is the sole living species of the genus Eucommia
Eucommia ulmoides," Eucommia is the only genus of the family Eucommiaceae, and was formerly considered to be a separate order, the Eucommiales"
Eucommia ulmoides," It is also sometimes known as ""gutta-percha tree"" or ""Chinese rubber tree"", but is not related to either the true gutta-percha tree of southeastern Asia, nor to the South American rubber tree"
Eucommia ulmoides,"


== Distribution ==
This tree is also occasionally planted in botanical gardens and other gardens in Europe, North America and elsewhere, being of interest as the only cold-tolerant (to at least -30 °C) rubber-producing tree"
Eucommia ulmoides,"
Fossils of other Eucommia species have been found in 10- to 35-million-year-old brown coal deposits in central Europe and widely in North America, indicating that the genus had a much wider range in the past"
Eucommia ulmoides,"


== Uses ==

It is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in Chinese herbology, where it is called dùzhòng (Chinese: 杜仲)"
Eucommia ulmoides,"
Because of the low production and high demand for natural rubber in China, a unique process has been developed to manufacture elastic materials with Eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG) as substitutes for natural rubber products"
Eucommia ulmoides," 
Unlike the latex used to produce natural rubber, the EUG is the polymer trans-1,4-polyisoprene"
Eucommia ulmoides," Thus materials made from EUG may demonstrate characteristics other than those of natural rubber, such as higher elasticity, lower thermoplastic temperature, etc"

Fagus grandifolia,"Fagus grandifolia, the American beech or North American beech, is the species of beech tree native to the eastern United States and extreme southeast Canada"
Fagus grandifolia,"
The genus name Fagus is Latin for ""beech"", and the specific epithet grandifolia comes from grandis ""large"" and folium ""leaf"""
Fagus grandifolia,"


== Distribution and varieties ==
The American beech is native to eastern North America, from Nova Scotia west to southern Ontario in southeastern Canada, west to Wisconsin and south to eastern Texas and northern Florida in the United States"
Fagus grandifolia,"
Trees in the southern half of the range are sometimes distinguished as a variety, F"
Fagus grandifolia, grandifolia var
Fagus grandifolia," caroliniana, but this is not considered distinct in the Flora of North America"
Fagus grandifolia, The Mexican beech (Fagus grandifolia var
Fagus grandifolia," mexicana), native to the mountains of central Mexico, is closely related, and is sometimes treated as a subspecies of American beech, but some botanists often classified as a distinct species"
Fagus grandifolia, The only Fagus species found in the Western Hemisphere (assuming F
Fagus grandifolia," mexicana is treated as a subspecies), F"
Fagus grandifolia, grandifolia is believed to have spanned the width of the North American continent all the way to the Pacific coast before the last ice age
Fagus grandifolia,"


== Description ==
It is a deciduous tree growing to 20–35 m (66–115 ft) tall, with smooth, silver-gray bark"
Fagus grandifolia," The leaves are dark green, simple and sparsely-toothed with small teeth that terminate each vein, 6–12 cm (2 1⁄4–4 3⁄4 in) long (rarely 15 cm, 6 in), with a short petiole"
Fagus grandifolia," The winter twigs are distinctive among North American trees, being long and slender (15–20 mm (5⁄8–3⁄4 in) by 2–3 mm (0"
Fagus grandifolia,079–0
Fagus grandifolia,118 in)) with two rows of overlapping scales on the buds
Fagus grandifolia," Beech buds are distinctly thin and long, resembling cigars; this characteristic makes beech trees relatively easy to identify"
Fagus grandifolia," The tree is monoecious, with flowers of both sexes on the same tree"
Fagus grandifolia," The fruit is a small, sharply-angled nut, borne in pairs in a soft-spined, four-lobed husk"
Fagus grandifolia," It has two means of reproduction: one is through the usual dispersal of seedlings, and the other is through root sprouts (new trees sprout from the roots in different locations)"
Fagus grandifolia,"The American beech is a shade-tolerant species, commonly found in forests in the final stage of succession"
Fagus grandifolia, Few trees in its natural range other than sugar maple match it for shade tolerance
Fagus grandifolia, Ecological succession is essentially the process of forests changing their composition through time; it is a pattern of events often observed on disturbed sites
Fagus grandifolia," Although sometimes found in pure stands, it is more often associated with sugar maple (forming the beech–maple climax community), yellow birch, and eastern hemlock, typically on moist, well-drained slopes and rich bottomlands"
Fagus grandifolia," Near its southern limit, it often shares canopy dominance with southern magnolia"
Fagus grandifolia," Although it has a reputation for slow growth (sometimes only 13 feet in 20 years), rich soil and ample moisture will greatly speed the process up"
Fagus grandifolia," American beech favors a well-watered, but also well-drained spot and is intolerant of urban pollution, salt, and soil compaction"
Fagus grandifolia," It also casts heavy shade and is an extremely thirsty tree with high moisture requirements compared to oaks, so it has a dense, shallow root system"
Fagus grandifolia," Although American beech's natural range extends across most of the eastern US and southeastern Canada, mature specimens are rare in lowland areas as early settlers quickly discovered that the presence of the tree indicated good farmland"

== Disease ==
Beech bark disease has become a major killer of beech trees in the Northeastern United States"
Fagus grandifolia," This disease occurs when the beech scale insect, Cryptococcus fagisuga, attacks the bark, creating a wound that is then infected by one of two different species of fungi in the genus Nectria"
Fagus grandifolia, This causes a canker to develop and the tree is eventually killed
Fagus grandifolia,"Beech blight aphids colonize branches of the tree, but without serious harm to otherwise healthy trees"
Fagus grandifolia," Below these colonies, deposits of sooty mold develop caused by the fungus Scorias spongiosa growing saprophytically on the honeydew the insects exude"
Fagus grandifolia, This is also harmless to the trees
Fagus grandifolia,"Beech leaf disease, first discovered in Ohio in 2012, is thought to be caused by nematodes"
Fagus grandifolia, It has spread to several other states as well as Canada and has the potential to kill millions of trees throughout North America and may threaten the beeches of Europe as well
Fagus grandifolia," 
Despite their high moisture needs, beeches succumb to flooding easily and their thin bark invites damage from animals, fire, and human activities"
Fagus grandifolia, Late spring frosts also cause considerable damage to the tree
Fagus grandifolia, The trunks of mature beeches often rot and develop cavities that are used by wildlife for habitation
Fagus grandifolia,"


== Uses ==

American beech is an important tree in forestry"
Fagus grandifolia," The wood is hard and difficult to cut or split, although at 43 pounds per foot it is not exceptionally heavy and it also rots relatively easily"
Fagus grandifolia," It is used for a wide variety of purposes, most notably bentwood furniture as beech wood easily bends when steamed"
Fagus grandifolia," It also makes high quality, long-burning firewood"
Fagus grandifolia,"
Like European beech bark, the American beech bark is smooth and uniform, making it an attraction for people to carve names, dates, decorative symbols such as love hearts or gang identifiers, and other material into its surface"
Fagus grandifolia," One such beech tree in Louisville, Kentucky, in what is now the southern part of Iroquois Park, bore the legend ""D"
Fagus grandifolia," Boone kilt a bar"" and the year in the late 18th century"
Fagus grandifolia," This carving was first reported in the 19th century, but is believed to have not been produced by Boone since he was an educated man who would not have written something so semi-literate"
Fagus grandifolia, The beech finally fell over in 1916 during a storm; its age was estimated at around 325 years
Fagus grandifolia, Its trunk is now on display at The Filson Historical Society
Fagus grandifolia,"
It is sometimes planted as an ornamental tree, but even within its native area, it is planted much less often than the European beech"
Fagus grandifolia," Although American beech can handle hotter climates, its European cousin is faster-growing and more pollution-tolerant, in addition to being easier to propagate"
Fagus grandifolia,"
American beech does not produce significant quantities of nuts until the tree is about 40 years old"
Fagus grandifolia, Large crops are produced by 60 years
Fagus grandifolia, The oldest documented tree is 246 years old
Fagus grandifolia," The fruit is a triangle-shaped shell containing 2–3 nuts inside, but many of them do not fill in, especially on solitary trees"
Fagus grandifolia," Beech nuts are edible to wildlife and humans, but are too small to be commercially valuable"
Fagus grandifolia,"
The mast (crop of nuts) from American beech provides food for numerous species of animals"
Fagus grandifolia," Among vertebrates alone, these include ruffed grouse, wild turkeys, raccoons, red/gray foxes, white-tailed deer, rabbits, squirrels, opossums, pheasants, black bears, porcupines, and humans"
Fagus grandifolia," For lepidopteran caterpillars feeding on American beech, see list of Lepidoptera that feed on beeches"
Fagus grandifolia," Deer occasionally browse on beech foliage, but it is not a preferred food"
Fagus grandifolia, Beech nuts were one of the primary foods of the now-extinct passenger pigeon; the clearing of beech and oak forests is pointed to as one of the major factors that may have contributed to the bird's extinction

Fraxinus americana,"Fraxinus americana, the white ash or American ash, is a species of ash tree native to eastern and central North America"
Fraxinus americana," It is found in mesophytic hardwood forests from Nova Scotia west to Minnesota, south to northern Florida, and southwest to eastern Texas"
Fraxinus americana," Isolated populations have also been found in western Texas, Wyoming, and Colorado, and the species is reportedly naturalized in Hawaii"
Fraxinus americana,There are an estimated 8 billion ash trees – the majority being the white ash trees and the green ash trees
Fraxinus americana,"


== Characteristics ==

The name white ash derives from the glaucous undersides of the leaves"
Fraxinus americana," It is similar in appearance to the green ash, making identification difficult"
Fraxinus americana," The lower sides of the leaves of white ash are lighter in color than their upper sides, and the outer surface of the twigs of white ash may be flaky or peeling"
Fraxinus americana," Green ash leaves are similar in color on upper and lower sides, and twigs are smoother"
Fraxinus americana, White Ash leaves turn yellow or red in Autumn
Fraxinus americana," Despite some overlap, the two species tend to grow in different locations as well; white ash is a forest tree that commonly occurs alongside sugar maple while green ash is a pioneer species that inhabits riparian zones and disturbed areas"
Fraxinus americana,  Its compound leaves more often than not have 7 leaflets per leaf whereas other ash trees are usually more diverse
Fraxinus americana,"


== Cultivation and uses ==
White ash is one of the most used trees for everyday purposes and, to keep up with high demand, is cultivated almost everywhere it can be"
Fraxinus americana," The wood is white and quite dense (within 20% of 670 kg/m3), strong, and straight-grained"
Fraxinus americana," Its species produces an ideal, Apical dominant Excurrent structured crown"
Fraxinus americana, And traditional timber of choice for production of baseball bats and tool handles
Fraxinus americana, The wood is also favorable for furniture and flooring
Fraxinus americana, Woodworkers use the timber mainly for interior uses due to high perishability in contact with ground soil
Fraxinus americana, It is also used to make lobster traps
Fraxinus americana," Since the 1950s, it has also become a popular choice for solid electric guitar bodies"
Fraxinus americana, It makes a very serviceable longbow if properly worked
Fraxinus americana," The wood was used in ceiling fan blades from the 1970s through the mid-1980s, though cane was sometimes simulated with plastic then"
Fraxinus americana, It is no longer used for ceiling fan blades in most countries
Fraxinus americana,"
White ash is not seen in cultivation as often as green ash due to its preference for undisturbed forest sites away from urban pollution and soil compaction, but sometimes has been planted for its consistently reliably autumn colors, which typically are bright orange and red hues as opposed to other species of ash that produce a uniform yellow color"
Fraxinus americana,"
Cultivation of White Ash differs across North American continent"
Fraxinus americana," For example, within City of Chicago region"
Fraxinus americana, 2010 Statistics show most common street tree species is White Ash at 6
Fraxinus americana,2%
Fraxinus americana, Along with third ranked Green type at 4
Fraxinus americana,"9%, Ashes combine to make up 11% percent of cities street trees"
Fraxinus americana," Along with overall population of 13,648,044 Million standing Ashes within Cook county alone"
Fraxinus americana," Autumn Purple, or Junginger"
Fraxinus americana, A wild Variety of American White Ash selected for its Purple leaf color
Fraxinus americana," Had been discovered by University of Wisconsin Horticulturist Karl Junginger of McKay nursery, Waterloo, Iowa"
Fraxinus americana," And after its introduction in 1956, it quickly became the Most popular and most expensive landscape selection"
Fraxinus americana," Surpassing even the high priced Ginkgo, London Plane & White/Burr Oak"
Fraxinus americana," A related species, Biltmore ash, is sometimes treated as a variety of white ash"
Fraxinus americana," However, other taxonomists argue that Biltmore ash is its own species (Fraxinus biltmoreana)"
Fraxinus americana,"North American native ash tree species are used by North American frogs as a critical food source, as the leaves that fall from the trees are particularly suitable for tadpoles to feed upon in ponds (both temporary and permanent), large puddles, and other water sources"
Fraxinus americana," Species such as red maple, which are taking the place of ash, due to the ash borer, are much less suitable for the frogs as a food source — resulting in poor frog survival rates and small frog sizes"
Fraxinus americana, It is the lack of tannins in the American ash variety that makes them good for the frogs as a food source and also not resistant to the ash borer
Fraxinus americana, Varieties of ash from outside North America typically have much higher tannin levels and resist the borer
Fraxinus americana," Maples and various non-native invasive trees, trees that are taking the place of American ash species in the North American ecosystem, typically have much higher leaf tannin levels"
Fraxinus americana, Ash species native to North America also provide important habit and food for various other creatures that are native to North America
Fraxinus americana,"


== Emerald ash borer ==

The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), also commonly known by the acronym EAB, is a green beetle native to Asia"
Fraxinus americana,"
In North America the emerald ash borer is an invasive species, highly destructive to ash trees in its introduced range"
Fraxinus americana, The damage of this insect rivals that of chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease
Fraxinus americana," To put its damage in perspective, the number of chestnuts killed by the chestnut blight was around 3"
Fraxinus americana,5 billion chestnut trees while there are 3
Fraxinus americana,5 billion ash trees in Ohio alone
Fraxinus americana, Dutch elm disease killed only 200 million elm trees while EAB threatens 7
Fraxinus americana,5 billion ash trees in the United States
Fraxinus americana, The insect threatens the entire North American genus Fraxinus
Fraxinus americana," Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s, and its subsequent detection in 2002, it has spread to eleven states and adjacent parts of Canada"
Fraxinus americana, It has killed at least 50 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America
Fraxinus americana," White ash exhibits a little more resistance to emerald ash borer than green ash, which has nearly no resistance, however this could also possibly be due to white ash not being used in landscaping as extensively and placed in high-stress environments"
Fraxinus americana,An infested tree can be recognized by premature fall color and leaf senescence observed on affected branches between August and last week of September
Fraxinus americana," Before emerald ash borer was officially identified, such dieback symptoms thought to have been caused by a vascular disease classified as Ash Yellows"
Fraxinus americana, Assuming damage caused by Borers taking advantage of weakened tree
Fraxinus americana," Other recognizable signs regularly observed have been upper crown dieback, epicormic shoots or sprouts, bark lesions, frass filled larval galleries, and deformed exit holes ; when the ""Flatheaded"" beetle has fully developed, it will bore out of the tree, in this instance, with a hole in a deformed ""D"" shape"
Fraxinus americana," In past it had been assumed, once any symptoms had started to show"
Fraxinus americana," Or ""Once a tree had become Infested"", it was likely too late to begin management"
Fraxinus americana, Today only on site professionals diagnosing an individual tree can responsibly make such determinations
Fraxinus americana," 


== Ash fungal disease ==
Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is a fungal disease that attacks ash trees"
Fraxinus americana," The disease causes leaf loss, crown dieback, and lesions in the bark"
Fraxinus americana," This fungus is, for the most part, fatal, both directly and indirectly, by weakening the tree's immune system so that it is more susceptible to attacks from pests or pathogens"
Fraxinus americana," Because of this fact, younger trees are affected far worse, and fully matured ash trees are capable of living long enough to reproduce"
Fraxinus americana,"
The disease has spread over most of Europe and has been confirmed in Britain, however, it has not yet been found in North America"
Fraxinus americana,"
The scale of the threat is not yet known, but is thought to be able to cause significant damage to the ash landscape of Europe and the UK"

Fraxinus nigra, The Shakers also made extensive use of the Black Ash for creating baskets
Fraxinus nigra," Also called Basket Ash, Brown Ash, Swamp Ash, hoop ash, and water ash"
Fraxinus nigra,"
It is also a popular wood for making electric guitars and basses, due to its good resonant qualities"
Fraxinus nigra,"


== Creating basket strips ==

Black ash is unique among all trees in North America in that it does not have fibers connecting the growth rings to each other"
Fraxinus nigra, This is a useful property for basket makers
Fraxinus nigra," By pounding on the wood with a mallet, the weaker spring wood layer is crushed, allowing the tougher and darker summer wood layer to be peeled off in long strips"
Fraxinus nigra," The long strips are trimmed, cleaned, and used in basket weaving"
Fraxinus nigra," Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands also make bark baskets from black ash, traditionally used for berry-gathering"
Fraxinus nigra,"


=== Usefulness to wildlife ===
North American native ash tree species are used by North American frogs as a critical food source, as the leaves that fall from the trees are particularly suitable for tadpoles to feed upon in ponds (both temporary and permanent), large puddles, and other water sources"
Fraxinus nigra," Species such as red maple, which are taking the place of ash, due to the ash borer, are much less suitable for the frogs as a food source—resulting in poor frog survival rates and small frog sizes"
Fraxinus nigra, It is the lack of tannins in the American ash variety that makes them good for the frogs as a food source and also not resistant to the ash borer
Fraxinus nigra, Varieties of ash from outside North America typically have much higher tannin levels and resist the borer
Fraxinus nigra," Maples and various non-native invasive trees, trees that are taking the place of American ash species in the North American ecosystem, typically have much higher leaf tannin levels"

Since the spelling may be confusing to pronounce, ginkgo is sometimes purposely misspelled as ""gingko"""
Ginkgo biloba,"


== Description ==

Ginkgos are large trees, normally reaching a height of 20–35 m (66–115 ft), with some specimens in China being over 50 m (160 ft)"
Ginkgo biloba," The tree has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage"
Ginkgo biloba," Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely branched; the crown becomes broader as the tree ages"
Ginkgo biloba," During autumn, the leaves turn a bright yellow, then fall, sometimes within a short space of time (one to 15 days)"
Ginkgo biloba," A combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant wood and the ability to form aerial roots and sprouts makes ginkgos long-lived, with some specimens claimed to be more than 2,500 years old"
Ginkgo biloba,"

Ginkgo is a relatively shade-intolerant species that (at least in cultivation) grows best in environments that are well-watered and well-drained"
Ginkgo biloba," The species shows a preference for disturbed sites; in the ""semiwild"" stands at Tianmu Mountains, many specimens are found along stream banks, rocky slopes, and cliff edges"
Ginkgo biloba,"  Accordingly, ginkgo retains a prodigious capacity for vegetative growth"
Ginkgo biloba," It is capable of sprouting from embedded buds near the base of the trunk (lignotubers, or basal chichi) in response to disturbances, such as soil erosion"
Ginkgo biloba, Old individuals are also capable of producing aerial roots on the undersides of large branches in response to disturbances such as crown damage; these roots can lead to successful clonal reproduction upon contacting the soil
Ginkgo biloba," These strategies are evidently important in the persistence of ginkgo; in a survey of the ""semiwild"" stands remaining in Tianmushan, 40% of the specimens surveyed were multistemmed, and few saplings were present"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Phytochemicals ===
Extracts of ginkgo leaves contain phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins,  flavonoid glycosides, such as myricetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin and quercetin, and the terpene trilactones, ginkgolides and bilobalides"
Ginkgo biloba," The leaves also contain unique ginkgo biflavones, as well as alkylphenols and polyprenols"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Branches ===
Ginkgo branches grow in length by growth of shoots with regularly spaced leaves, as seen on most trees"
Ginkgo biloba," From the axils of these leaves, ""spur shoots"" (also known as short shoots) develop on second-year growth"
Ginkgo biloba, Short shoots have very short internodes (so they may grow only one or two centimeters in several years) and their leaves are usually unlobed
Ginkgo biloba," They are short and knobby, and are arranged regularly on the branches except on first-year growth"
Ginkgo biloba," Because of the short internodes, leaves appear to be clustered at the tips of short shoots, and reproductive structures are formed only on them (see pictures below – seeds and leaves are visible on short shoots)"
Ginkgo biloba," In ginkgos, as in other plants that possess them, short shoots allow the formation of new leaves in the older parts of the crown"
Ginkgo biloba," After a number of years, a short shoot may change into a long (ordinary) shoot, or vice versa"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Leaves ===

The leaves are unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins radiating out into the leaf blade, sometimes bifurcating (splitting), but never anastomosing to form a network"
Ginkgo biloba, Two veins enter the leaf blade at the base and fork repeatedly in two; this is known as dichotomous venation
Ginkgo biloba, The leaves are usually 5–10 cm (2
Ginkgo biloba,0–3
Ginkgo biloba,"9 in), but sometimes up to 15 cm (5"
Ginkgo biloba,9 in) long

Ginkgo biloba," Ginkgos are prized for their autumn foliage, which is a deep saffron yellow"
Ginkgo biloba,"
Leaves of long shoots are usually notched or lobed, but only from the outer surface, between the veins"
Ginkgo biloba," They are borne both on the more rapidly growing branch tips, where they are alternate and spaced out, and also on the short, stubby spur shoots, where they are clustered at the tips"
Ginkgo biloba, Leaves are green both on the top and bottom and have stomata on both sides
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Reproduction ===
Ginkgos are dioecious, with separate sexes, some trees being female and others being male"
Ginkgo biloba," Male plants produce small pollen cones with sporophylls, each bearing two microsporangia spirally arranged around a central axis"
Ginkgo biloba,"
Female plants do not produce cones"
Ginkgo biloba," Two ovules are formed at the end of a stalk, and after pollination, one or both develop into seeds"
Ginkgo biloba, The seed is 1
Ginkgo biloba,5–2 cm long
Ginkgo biloba," Its fleshy outer layer (the sarcotesta) is light yellow-brown, soft, and fruit-like"
Ginkgo biloba," It is attractive in appearance, but contains butyric acid (also known as butanoic acid) and smells like rancid butter or vomit when fallen"
Ginkgo biloba," Beneath the sarcotesta is the hard sclerotesta (the ""shell"" of the seed) and a papery endotesta, with the nucellus surrounding the female gametophyte at the center"
Ginkgo biloba,"

The fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs via motile sperm, as in cycads, ferns, mosses and algae"
Ginkgo biloba," The sperm are large (about 70–90 micrometres) and are similar to the sperm of cycads, which are slightly larger"
Ginkgo biloba, Ginkgo sperm were first discovered by the Japanese botanist Sakugoro Hirase in 1896
Ginkgo biloba," The sperm have a complex multi-layered structure, which is a continuous belt of basal bodies that form the base of several thousand flagella which actually have a cilia-like motion"
Ginkgo biloba, The flagella/cilia apparatus pulls the body of the sperm forwards
Ginkgo biloba," The sperm have only a tiny distance to travel to the archegonia, of which there are usually two or three"
Ginkgo biloba," Two sperm are produced, one of which successfully fertilizes the ovule"
Ginkgo biloba," Although it is widely held that fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs just before or after they fall in early autumn, embryos ordinarily occur in seeds just before and after they drop from the tree"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Genome ===
Chinese scientists published a draft genome of Ginkgo biloba in 2016"
Ginkgo biloba, The tree has a large genome of 10
Ginkgo biloba,"6 billion DNA nucleobase ""letters"" (the human genome has three billion) and about 41,840 predicted genes which enable a considerable number of antibacterial and chemical defense mechanisms"
Ginkgo biloba,"In 2020, a study in China of gingko trees up to 667 years old showed little effects of aging, finding that the trees continued to grow with age and displayed no genetic evidence of senescence"
Ginkgo biloba,"


== Taxonomy ==
Carl Linnaeus described the species in 1771, the specific epithet biloba derived from the Latin bis, ""two"" and loba, ""lobed"", referring to the shape of the leaves"
Ginkgo biloba," Two names for the species recognise the botanist Richard Salisbury, a placement by Nelson as Pterophyllus salisburiensis and the earlier Salisburia adiantifolia proposed by James Edward Smith"
Ginkgo biloba," The epithet of the latter may have been intended to denote a characteristic resembling Adiantum, the genus of maidenhair ferns"
Ginkgo biloba,The scientific name Ginkgo is the result of a spelling error that occurred three centuries ago
Ginkgo biloba," Kanji typically have multiple pronunciations in Japanese, and the characters 銀杏 used for ginnan can also be pronounced ginkyō"
Ginkgo biloba," Engelbert Kaempfer, the first Westerner to investigate the species in 1690, wrote down this pronunciation in the notes that he later used for the Amoenitates Exoticae (1712) with the ""awkward"" spelling ""ginkgo"""
Ginkgo biloba," This appears to be a simple error of Kaempfer; taking his spelling of other Japanese words containing the syllable ""kyō"" into account, a more precise romanization following his writing habits would have been ""ginkio"" or ""ginkjo"""
Ginkgo biloba," Linnaeus, who relied on Kaempfer when dealing with Japanese plants, adopted the spelling given in Kaempfer's ""Flora Japonica"" (Amoenitates Exoticae, p"
Ginkgo biloba, 811)
Ginkgo biloba,"
Despite its complicated spelling, which is due to an exceptionally complicated etymology including a transcription error, ""ginkgo"" is usually pronounced , which has given rise to the common other spelling ""gingko"""
Ginkgo biloba, The spelling pronunciation  is also documented in some dictionaries
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Classification ===
The relationship of ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain"
Ginkgo biloba," It has been placed loosely in the divisions Spermatophyta and Pinophyta, but no consensus has been reached"
Ginkgo biloba," Since its seeds are not protected by an ovary wall, it can morphologically be considered a gymnosperm"
Ginkgo biloba," The apricot-like structures produced by female ginkgo trees are technically not fruits, but are seeds that have a shell consisting of a soft and fleshy section (the sarcotesta), and a hard section (the sclerotesta)"
Ginkgo biloba, The sarcotesta has a strong smell that most people find unpleasant
Ginkgo biloba,"
The ginkgo is classified in its own division, the Ginkgophyta, comprising the single class Ginkgoopsida, order Ginkgoales, family Ginkgoaceae, genus Ginkgo and is the only extant species within this group"

== Distribution and habitat ==
Although Ginkgo biloba and other species of the genus were once widespread throughout the world, its range shrank until by two million years ago, it was restricted to a small area of China"
Ginkgo biloba,"
For centuries, it was thought to be extinct in the wild, but is now known to grow in at least two small areas in Zhejiang province in eastern China, in the Tianmushan Reserve"
Ginkgo biloba," However, high genetic uniformity exists among ginkgo trees from these areas, arguing against a natural origin of these populations and suggesting the ginkgo trees in these areas may have been planted and preserved by Chinese monks over a period of about 1,000 years"
Ginkgo biloba," This study demonstrates a greater genetic diversity in Southwestern China populations, supporting glacial refugia in mountains surrounding eastern Tibetan Plateau, where several old-growth candidates for wild populations have been reported"
Ginkgo biloba," Whether native ginkgo populations still exist has not been demonstrated unequivocally, but evidence grows favouring these Southwestern populations as wild, from genetic data but also from history of those territories, with bigger Ginkgo biloba trees being older than surrounding human settlements"
Ginkgo biloba,"Where it occurs in the wild, it is found infrequently in deciduous forests and valleys on acidic loess (i"

== Uses ==


=== Horticulture ===
Ginkgos are popular subjects for growing as penjing and bonsai; they can be kept artificially small and tended over centuries"
Ginkgo biloba," Furthermore, the trees are easy to propagate from seed"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Cooking ===

The nut-like gametophytes inside the seeds are particularly esteemed in Asia, and are a traditional Chinese food"
Ginkgo biloba," Ginkgo nuts are used in congee, and are often served at special occasions such as weddings and the Chinese New Year (as part of the vegetarian dish called Buddha's delight)"
Ginkgo biloba," In Chinese culture, they are believed to have health benefits; some also consider them to have aphrodisiac qualities"
Ginkgo biloba," Japanese cooks add ginkgo seeds (called ginnan) to dishes such as chawanmushi, and cooked seeds are often eaten along with other dishes"
Ginkgo biloba,"
When eaten in large quantities or over a long period, the gametophyte (meat) of the seed can cause poisoning by 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (MPN)"
Ginkgo biloba, MPN is heat-stable and not destroyed by cooking
Ginkgo biloba, Studies have demonstrated the convulsions caused by MPN can be prevented or treated successfully with pyridoxine (vitamin B6)
Ginkgo biloba,"
Some people are sensitive to the chemicals in the sarcotesta, the outer fleshy coating"
Ginkgo biloba," These people should handle the seeds with care when preparing the seeds for consumption, wearing disposable gloves"
Ginkgo biloba, The symptoms are allergic contact dermatitis or blisters similar to that caused by contact with poison ivy
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Traditional medicine ===
The first use as a medicine is recorded in the late 15th century in China; among western countries, its first registered medicinal use was in Germany in 1965"
Ginkgo biloba," Despite use, controlled studies do not support the extract's efficacy for most of the indicated conditions"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Dietary supplement ===
Although extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaf sold as dietary supplements may be marketed as being beneficial for cognitive function, there is no evidence for effects on memory or attention in healthy people"
Ginkgo biloba," Gingko extract has also been studied in Alzheimer's disease, but there is no good evidence that it has any effect"
Ginkgo biloba,"Systematic reviews have shown there is no evidence for effectiveness of ginkgo in treating high blood pressure, menopause-related cognitive decline, tinnitus, post-stroke recovery, peripheral arterial disease, macular degeneration, or altitude sickness"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Adverse effects ===
The use of Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts may have undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anticoagulants, such as aspirin or warfarin, although studies have found ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin in healthy subjects"
Ginkgo biloba," Additional side effects include increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, heart palpitations, and restlessness"
Ginkgo biloba,"According to a systemic review, the effects of ginkgo on pregnant women may include increased bleeding time, and it should be avoided during lactation because of inadequate safety evidence"
Ginkgo biloba,"Ginkgo biloba leaves and sarcotesta also contain ginkgolic acids, which are highly allergenic, long-chain alkylphenols such as bilobol or adipostatin A (bilobol is a substance related to anacardic acid from cashew nut shells and urushiols present in poison ivy and other Toxicodendron spp"
Ginkgo biloba,") Individuals with a history of strong allergic reactions to poison ivy, mangoes, cashews and other alkylphenol-producing plants are more likely to experience allergic reaction when consuming non-standardized ginkgo-containing preparations, combinations, or extracts thereof"

Ginkgo biloba, Overconsumption of seeds from Gingko biloba can deplete vitamin B6
Ginkgo biloba,"


== History ==

The ginkgo is a living fossil, with fossils recognisably related to modern ginkgo from the Permian, dating back 270 million years"
Ginkgo biloba," The most plausible ancestral group for the order Ginkgoales is the Pteridospermatophyta, also known as the ""seed ferns""; specifically the order Peltaspermales"
Ginkgo biloba," The closest living relatives of the clade are the cycads, which share with the extant G"
Ginkgo biloba, biloba the characteristic of motile sperm
Ginkgo biloba,"
Fossil plants with leaves that have more than four veins per segment have customarily been assigned to the taxon Ginkgo, while the taxon Baiera is used to classify those with fewer than four veins per segment"
Ginkgo biloba, Sphenobaiera has been used for plants with a broadly wedge-shaped leaf that lacks a distinct leaf stem
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Rise and decline ===

Fossils attributable to the genus Ginkgo first appeared in the Early Jurassic"
Ginkgo biloba," One of the earliest fossils ascribed to the Ginkgophyta is Trichopitys, distinguished by having multiple-forked leaves with cylindrical (not flattened), thread-like ultimate divisions"
Ginkgo biloba, The genus Ginkgo diversified and spread throughout Laurasia during the middle Jurassic and Early Cretaceous
Ginkgo biloba,"
The Ginkgophyta declined in diversity as the Cretaceous progressed, and by the Paleocene, Ginkgo adiantoides was the only Ginkgo species left in the Northern Hemisphere, while a markedly different (and poorly documented) form persisted in the Southern Hemisphere"
Ginkgo biloba," Along with that of ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids, the species diversity in the genus Ginkgo drops through the Cretaceous, at the same time the flowering plants were on the rise; this supports the hypothesis that, over time, flowering plants with better adaptations to disturbance displaced Ginkgo and its associates"
Ginkgo biloba,"At the end of the Pliocene, Ginkgo fossils disappeared from the fossil record everywhere except in a small area of central China, where the modern species survived"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Limited number of species ===

It is doubtful whether the Northern Hemisphere fossil species of Ginkgo can be reliably distinguished"
Ginkgo biloba," Given the slow pace of evolution and morphological similarity between members of the genus, there may have been only one or two species existing in the Northern Hemisphere through the entirety of the Cenozoic: present-day G"
Ginkgo biloba, biloba (including G
Ginkgo biloba, adiantoides) and G
Ginkgo biloba, gardneri from the Paleocene of Scotland
Ginkgo biloba,"At least morphologically, G"
Ginkgo biloba, gardneri and the Southern Hemisphere species are the only known post-Jurassic taxa that can be unequivocally recognised
Ginkgo biloba, The remainder may have been ecotypes or subspecies
Ginkgo biloba, The implications would be that G
Ginkgo biloba," biloba had occurred over an extremely wide range, had remarkable genetic flexibility and, though evolving genetically, never showed much speciation"
Ginkgo biloba,"
While it may seem improbable that a single species may exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the ginkgo's life-history parameters fit: Extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution; and (as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record) extreme ecological conservatism (restriction to disturbed streamside environments)"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Adaptation to a single environment ===
Given the slow rate of evolution of the genus, Ginkgo possibly represents a pre-angiosperm strategy for survival in disturbed streamside environments"
Ginkgo biloba," Ginkgo evolved in an era before flowering plants, when ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids dominated disturbed streamside environments, forming low, open, shrubby canopies"
Ginkgo biloba," Ginkgo's large seeds and habit of ""bolting"" – growing to a height of 10 meters before elongating its side branches – may be adaptions to such an environment"
Ginkgo biloba,"
Modern-day G"
Ginkgo biloba," biloba grows best in environments that are well-watered and drained, and the extremely similar fossil Ginkgo favored similar environments: The sediment record at the majority of fossil Ginkgo localities indicates it grew primarily in disturbed environments, along streams and levees"
Ginkgo biloba," Ginkgo, therefore, presents an ""ecological paradox"" because while it possesses some favorable traits for living in disturbed environments (clonal reproduction) many of its other life-history traits are the opposite of those exhibited by modern plants that thrive in disturbed settings (slow growth, large seed size, late reproductive maturity)"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Naming ===
The older Chinese name for this plant is 銀果, meaning ""silver fruit"", pronounced yínguǒ in Mandarin or Ngan-gwo in Cantonese"
Ginkgo biloba," The most usual names today are 白果 (bái guǒ), meaning ""white fruit"", and 銀杏 (yínxìng), meaning ""silver apricot"""
Ginkgo biloba," The name 銀杏 was borrowed in Japanese ぎんなん (ginnan) and Korean 은행 (eunhaeng), when the tree was introduced from China"
Ginkgo biloba,"


== Cultivation ==

Ginkgo has long been cultivated in China; some planted trees at temples are believed to be over 1,500 years old"
Ginkgo biloba," The first record of Europeans encountering it is in 1690 in Japanese temple gardens, where the tree was seen by the German botanist Engelbert Kaempfer"
Ginkgo biloba," Because of its status in Buddhism and Confucianism, the ginkgo is also widely planted in Korea and parts of Japan; in both areas, some naturalization has occurred, with ginkgos seeding into natural forests"
Ginkgo biloba,"
In some areas, most intentionally planted ginkgos are male cultivars grafted onto plants propagated from seed, because the male trees will not produce the malodorous seeds"
Ginkgo biloba, The popular cultivar ‘Autumn Gold’ is a clone of a male plant
Ginkgo biloba,"
The disadvantage of male Ginkgo biloba trees is that they are highly allergenic"
Ginkgo biloba," They have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 7 (out of 10), whereas female trees, which can produce no pollen, have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 2"
Ginkgo biloba,"Female cultivars include ‘Liberty Splendor’, ‘Santa Cruz’, and ‘Golden Girl’, the latter so named because of the striking yellow color of its leaves in the fall; all female cultivars release zero pollen"
Ginkgo biloba,"Many cultivars are listed in the literature in the UK, of which the compact ‘Troll’ has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit"
Ginkgo biloba,"Ginkgos adapt well to the urban environment, tolerating pollution and confined soil spaces"
Ginkgo biloba," They rarely suffer disease problems, even in urban conditions, and are attacked by few insects"
Ginkgo biloba,"


== Society and culture ==

The ginkgo leaf is the symbol of the Urasenke school of Japanese tea ceremony"
Ginkgo biloba," The tree is the official tree of the Japanese capital of Tokyo, and the symbol of Tokyo is a ginkgo leaf"
Ginkgo biloba, The logo of Osaka University has been a simplified ginkgo leaf since 1991 when designer Ikko Tanaka created it for the university's sixtieth anniversary
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== Hiroshima ===

Extreme examples of the ginkgo's tenacity may be seen in Hiroshima, Japan, where six trees growing between 1–2 kilometres (0"
Ginkgo biloba,62–1
Ginkgo biloba,24 mi) from the 1945 atom bomb explosion were among the few living things in the area to survive the blast
Ginkgo biloba," Although almost all other plants (and animals) in the area were killed, the ginkgos, though charred, survived and were soon healthy again, among other hibakujumoku (trees that survived the blast)"
Ginkgo biloba,"
The six trees are still alive: They are marked with signs at Housenbou (報専坊) temple (planted in 1850), Shukkei-en (planted about 1740), Jōsei-ji (planted 1900), at the former site of Senda Elementary School near Miyukibashi, at the Myōjōin temple, and an Edo period-cutting at Anraku-ji temple"
Ginkgo biloba,"


=== 1000-year-old ginkgo at Tsurugaoka Hachimangū ===

The ginkgo tree that had stood next to Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū's stone stairway approximately from the Shinto shrine's foundation in 1063, and which appears in almost every old depiction of the shrine, was completely uprooted and irreparably damaged on March 10, 2010"
Ginkgo biloba," According to an expert who analyzed the tree, the fall was likely due to rot"
Ginkgo biloba,"Later, both the stump of the severed tree and a replanted section of the trunk sprouted leaves"
Ginkgo biloba," The shrine is in the city of Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan"
Ginkgo biloba,"
The tree was nicknamed kakure-ichō (hiding ginkgo), deriving from an Edo period urban legend which told of the assassination of Minamoto no Sanetomo by his nephew, Kugyō, who had been hiding behind the tree"
Ginkgo biloba,"

Gleditsia triacanthos,"The honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos),  also known as the thorny locust or thorny honeylocust, is a deciduous tree in the family Fabaceae, native to central North America where it is mostly found in the moist soil of river valleys"
Gleditsia triacanthos," Honey locust is highly adaptable to different environments, has been introduced worldwide, and is an aggressive invasive species"
Gleditsia triacanthos,"


== Description ==

The honey locust, Gleditsia triacanthos, can reach a height of 20–30 m (66–98 ft), with fast growth, and is relatively short-lived, having a life span of about 120 years"
Gleditsia triacanthos, The leaves are pinnately compound on older trees but bipinnately compound on vigorous young trees
Gleditsia triacanthos, The leaflets are 1
Gleditsia triacanthos,5–2
Gleditsia triacanthos,5 cm (5⁄8–1 in) (smaller on bipinnate leaves) and bright green
Gleditsia triacanthos, They turn yellow in the fall (autumn)
Gleditsia triacanthos," Honey locusts leaf out relatively late in spring, but generally slightly earlier than the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia)"
Gleditsia triacanthos," The strongly scented cream-colored flowers appear in late spring, in clusters emerging from the base of the leaf axils"
Gleditsia triacanthos,"
The fruit of the honey locust is a flat legume (pod) that matures in early autumn"
Gleditsia triacanthos, The pods are generally between 15–20 cm (6–8 in)
Gleditsia triacanthos," The seeds are dispersed by grazing herbivores such as cattle and horses, which eat the pod pulp and excrete the seeds in droppings; the animal's digestive system assists in breaking down the hard seed coat, making germination easier"
Gleditsia triacanthos," In addition, the seeds are released in the host's manure, providing fertilizer for them"
Gleditsia triacanthos, Honey locust seed pods ripen in late spring and germinate rapidly when temperatures are warm enough
Gleditsia triacanthos,"
Honey locusts commonly have thorns 3–10 cm (1 1⁄4–4 in) long growing out of the branches, some reaching lengths over 20 cm (8 in); these may be single, or branched into several points, and commonly form dense clusters"
Gleditsia triacanthos," The thorns are fairly soft and green when young, harden and turn red as they age, then fade to ash grey and turn brittle when mature"
Gleditsia triacanthos," These thorns are thought to have evolved to protect the trees from browsing Pleistocene megafauna, which may also have been involved in seed dispersal, but the size and spacing of them is less useful in defending against smaller extant herbivores such as deer"
Gleditsia triacanthos, Thornless forms (Gleditsia triacanthos var
Gleditsia triacanthos, inermis) are occasionally found growing wild and are available as nursery plants
Gleditsia triacanthos, Hybridization of honey locust with water locust (G
Gleditsia triacanthos, aquatica) has been reported
Gleditsia triacanthos,"


== Cultivation and history ==
Its cultivars are popular ornamental plants, especially in the northern plains of North America where few other trees can survive and prosper"
Gleditsia triacanthos," It tolerates urban conditions, compacted soil, road salt, alkaline soil, heat, and drought"
Gleditsia triacanthos, The popularity is in part due to the fact that it transplants so easily
Gleditsia triacanthos," The fast growth rate and tolerance of poor site conditions make it valued in areas where shade is wanted quickly, such as new parks or housing developments, and in disturbed and reclaimed environments, such as mine tailings"
Gleditsia triacanthos," It is resistant to gypsy moths but is defoliated by another pest, the mimosa webworm"
Gleditsia triacanthos," Spider mites, cankers, and galls are a problem with some trees"
Gleditsia triacanthos, Many cultivated varieties do not have thorns
Gleditsia triacanthos,"


=== Agriculture ===

The species is a major invasive environmental and economic weed in agricultural regions of Australia"
Gleditsia triacanthos, The plant forms thickets and destroys the pasture required for livestock to survive
Gleditsia triacanthos, The thickets choke waterways and prevent both domestic and native animals from drinking and also harbour vermin
Gleditsia triacanthos, The spines cause damage to both people and domestic and native wildlife and puncture vehicle tires
Gleditsia triacanthos, In much of the Midwest of the United States the honey locust is also considered a weed tree and a pest that establishes itself in farm fields
Gleditsia triacanthos," In other regions of the world, ranchers and farmers who employ monocropping deem honey locust a nuisance weed; its fast growth allows it to out-compete grasses and other crops"
Gleditsia triacanthos,"


== Uses ==


=== Food ===

The pulp on the inside of the pods is edible (unlike the black locust, which is toxic) and consumed by wildlife and livestock"
Gleditsia triacanthos,"Despite its name, the honey locust is not a significant honey plant"
Gleditsia triacanthos," The name derives from the sweet taste of the legume pulp, which was used for food and traditional medicine by Native American people, and can also be used to make tea"
Gleditsia triacanthos," The long pods, which eventually dry and ripen to brown or maroon, are surrounded in a tough, leathery skin that adheres strongly to the pulp within"
Gleditsia triacanthos," The pulp—bright green in unripe pods—is strongly sweet, crisp and succulent in ripe pods"
Gleditsia triacanthos, Dark brown tannin-rich beans are found in slots within the pulp
Gleditsia triacanthos,"


=== Timber ===
Honey locusts produce a high quality, durable wood that polishes well, but the tree does not grow in sufficient numbers to support a bulk industry"
Gleditsia triacanthos," However, a niche market exists for honey locust furniture"
Gleditsia triacanthos," It is also used for posts and rails because of the dense, rot-resistant nature of the wood"
Gleditsia triacanthos," In the past, the hard thorns of the younger trees were used as nails and the wood itself was used to fashion treenails for shipbuilding"
Gleditsia triacanthos,"


== Nitrogen fixation ==
The ability of Gleditsia to fix nitrogen is disputed"
Gleditsia triacanthos, Many scientific sources state that Gleditsia does not fix nitrogen
Gleditsia triacanthos," Some support this statement with the fact that Gleditsia does not form root nodules with symbiotic bacteria, the assumption being that without nodulation, no nitrogen fixation can occur"
Gleditsia triacanthos," In contrast, many popular sources, permaculture publications in particular, claim that Gleditsia does fix nitrogen but by some other mechanism"
Gleditsia triacanthos,"
There are anatomical, ecological, and taxonomic indications of nitrogen fixation in non-nodulating legumes"
Gleditsia triacanthos, Both nodulating and non-nodulating species have been observed to grow well in nitrogen-poor soil with non-nodulating legumes even dominating some sites
Gleditsia triacanthos, The litter and seeds of non-nodulating species contains higher nitrogen than non-legumes and sometimes even higher than nodulating legumes growing on the same site
Gleditsia triacanthos," How this happens is not yet well understood but there has been some observations of nitrogenase activity in non-nodulating leguminous plants, including honey locust"
Gleditsia triacanthos," Electron microscopy indicates the presence of clusters around the inner cortex of roots, just outside the xylem, that resemble colonies of rhizobial bacterioids"
Gleditsia triacanthos, These may well constitute the evolutionary precursors in legumes for nitrogen fixation through nodulation
Gleditsia triacanthos," It is not known whether the non-nodulating nitrogen fixation, if it exists, does benefit neighboring plants as is said to be the case with nodulating legumes"
Gleditsia triacanthos,"


== Research ==
In research using databases, more than 60 phytochemicals were identified from honey locust, including polyphenols, triterpenes, sterols, and saponins, with in vitro studies assessing for possible biological activity"

Juglans nigra,"Visually, black walnut is similar to the butternut (Juglans cinerea) in leaf shape, and the range also overlaps significantly"
Juglans nigra," The fruits are quite different, and their presence makes an identification easy, as black walnut fruits are round and butternuts are more oval-oblong shaped"
Juglans nigra," When a fruit is not available, two species can be differentiated based on the leaf scars, or the place where the leaf meets the stem: butternut has a leaf scar with a flat upper edge and with a velvety ridge above that flat part, but black walnut has an indented leaf scar with no hairy ridge"
Juglans nigra,"


== Ecology ==
Black walnut is primarily a pioneer species similar to red and silver maple and black cherry"
Juglans nigra," Because of this, black walnut is a common weed tree found along roadsides, fields, and forest edges in the eastern US"
Juglans nigra," It will grow in closed forests, but is classified as shade intolerant; this means it requires full sun for optimal growth and nut production"
Juglans nigra,"
Black walnut's native range extends across much of the eastern US"
Juglans nigra," It is absent from the coastal plain south of North Carolina as well as the Mississippi Valley, and does not occur in the northern tier of the eastern US, where the frost-free season is too short for the nuts to develop"
Juglans nigra," Its western range extends all the way to the eastern Great Plains, after which climate conditions become too dry for it"
Juglans nigra,"
Black walnut is one of the most abundant trees in the eastern US, particularly the Northeast, and its numbers are increasing due to epidemics that have affected other tree species, including emerald ash borer, chestnut blight, butternut canker, wooly hemlock adelgid, dogwood anthracnose, Dutch elm disease, and Gypsy moth infestations"
Juglans nigra, Widespread clear-cutting of oaks due to Gypsy moth damage in the 1970s-80s particularly aided in the tree's spread
Juglans nigra," The aggressive competitive strategy of black walnut such as its fast growth, alleopathic chemicals, and rodent-dispersed seeds, have also contributed"
Juglans nigra,"
The nuts are food for many rodents and make up to 10% of the diet of eastern fox squirrels"
Juglans nigra, The nuts are also eaten by species of birds
Juglans nigra," The leaves are browsed by white tailed deer, although they are not a preferred food"
Juglans nigra," Squirrels benefit this species by distributing and burying the seeds; if the seeds are not reclaimed by the squirrel, they will germinate and help disperse the species"
Juglans nigra,"
Where the range of the eastern black walnut overlaps that of the Texas black walnut (J"
Juglans nigra," microcarpa), the two species sometimes interbreed, producing populations with characteristics intermediate between the two species"
Juglans nigra, J
Juglans nigra,nigra and J
Juglans nigra, cinerea often grow in the same range as well but they do not hybridize naturally
Juglans nigra,The tree's roots often form endomycorrhizal relationships with fungi in the genus Glomus
Juglans nigra, Some endomycorrhizal relations improve the plant's growth
Juglans nigra,Species often associated with J
Juglans nigra," nigra include yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash (Fraxinus americana), black cherry (Prunus serotina), basswood (Tilia americana), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), oaks (Quercus spp"
Juglans nigra,"), and hickories (Carya spp"
Juglans nigra,)
Juglans nigra," Near the western edge of its range, black walnut may be confined to floodplains, where it grows either with American elm (Ulmus americana), common hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and boxelder (Acer negundo), or with basswood and red oak (Quercus rubra) on lower slopes and other favorable sites"
Juglans nigra,"


== Uses ==


=== Planting ===
While its primary native region is the Midwest and east-central United States, the black walnut was introduced into Europe in 1629 and is also cultivated in Hawaii"
Juglans nigra, It is cultivated there and in North America as a forest tree for its high-quality wood
Juglans nigra," Black walnut plantings can be made to produce timber, nuts, or both timber and nuts"
Juglans nigra, Patented timber-type trees were selected and released from Purdue University in the early 1990s
Juglans nigra, These trees have been sporadically available from nurseries
Juglans nigra," Varieties include Purdue #1, which can be used for both timber and nut production, though nut quality is poor compared to varieties selected specifically as nut producers"
Juglans nigra,"

Grafted, nut-producing trees are available from several nurseries operating in the U"
Juglans nigra,S
Juglans nigra," Selections worth considering include Thomas, Neel #1, Thomas Myers, Pounds #2, Stoker, Surprise, Emma K, Sparrow, S127, and McGinnis"
Juglans nigra," Several older varieties, such as Kwik Krop, are still in cultivation; while they make decent nuts, they would not be recommended for commercial planting"
Juglans nigra, A variety index and characteristics guide is available from Missouri Extension
Juglans nigra,"
Pollination requirements should be considered when planting black walnuts"
Juglans nigra," As is typical of many species in Juglandaceae, Juglans nigra trees tend to be monoecious, i"
Juglans nigra,e
Juglans nigra,
Juglans nigra, produce pollen first and then pistillate flowers or else produce pistillate flowers and then pollen
Juglans nigra, An early pollen-producer should be grouped with other varieties that produce pistillate flowers so all varieties benefit from overlap
Juglans nigra," Cranz, Thomas, and Neel #1 make a good pollination trio"
Juglans nigra," A similar group for more northern climates would be Sparrow, S127, and Mintle"
Juglans nigra,"
Sometimes black walnut is planted as part of reclaiming mines"
Juglans nigra," When growing young trees weed control is critical for healthy establishment of the trees, without weed control the young trees are harmed significantly in their growth rate"
Juglans nigra,"
J"
Juglans nigra," nigra is also grown as a specimen ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, growing to 30 m (100 ft) tall by 20 m (65 ft) broad"
Juglans nigra, It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit
Juglans nigra,"


=== Food ===

Black walnut nuts are shelled commercially in the United States"
Juglans nigra, About 65% of the annual wild harvest comes from the U
Juglans nigra,S
Juglans nigra," state of Missouri, and the largest processing plant is operated by Hammons Products in Stockton, Missouri"
Juglans nigra," The nutmeats provide a robust, distinctive, natural flavor and crunch as a food ingredient"
Juglans nigra,"  Popular uses include ice cream, bakery goods and confections"
Juglans nigra,"  Consumers include black walnuts in traditional treats, such as cakes, cookies, fudge, and pies, during the fall holiday season"
Juglans nigra,"  The nuts' nutritional profile leads to uses in other foods, such as salads, fish, pork, chicken, vegetables and pasta dishes"
Juglans nigra,"
Nutritionally similar to the milder-tasting English walnut, the black walnut kernel is high in unsaturated fat and protein"
Juglans nigra,  An analysis of nut oil from five named J
Juglans nigra," nigra cultivars (Ogden, Sparrow, Baugh, Carter and Thomas) showed the most prevalent fatty acid in J"
Juglans nigra, nigra oil is linoleic acid (27
Juglans nigra,80–33
Juglans nigra,"34 g/100g dry kernel), followed (in the same units) by oleic acid (14"
Juglans nigra,52–24
Juglans nigra,"40), linolenic acid (1"
Juglans nigra,61–3
Juglans nigra,"23), palmitic acid (1"
Juglans nigra,61–2
Juglans nigra,"15), and stearic acid (1"
Juglans nigra,07–1
Juglans nigra,69)
Juglans nigra,  The oil from the cultivar Carter had the highest mol percentage of linoleate (61
Juglans nigra,"6), linolenate (5"
Juglans nigra,"97%), and palmitate (3"
Juglans nigra,98%); the oil from the cultivar Baugh had the highest mol percentage of oleate (42
Juglans nigra,7%); the oil from the cultivar Ogden has the highest mol percentage of stearate (2
Juglans nigra,98%)
Juglans nigra,"
Tapped in spring, the tree yields a sweet sap that can be drunk or concentrated into syrup or sugar that is not unlike the sap of sugar maple"
Juglans nigra,"


==== Nut processing by hand ====

The extraction of the kernel from the fruit of the black walnut is difficult"
Juglans nigra,"  The thick, hard shell is tightly bound by tall ridges to a thick husk"
Juglans nigra, Rolling the nut underfoot on a hard surface such as a driveway is a common method; commercial huskers use a car tire rotating against a metal mesh
Juglans nigra,  Some take a thick plywood board and drill a nut-sized hole in it (from one to two inches in diameter) and smash the nut through using a hammer
Juglans nigra,  The nut goes through and the husk remains behind
Juglans nigra,"While the flavor of the Juglans nigra kernel is prized, the difficulty in preparing it may account for the wider popularity and availability of the Persian walnut"
Juglans nigra,"


=== Dye ===
Black walnut drupes contain juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), plumbagin (yellow quinone pigments), and tannin"
Juglans nigra," These compounds cause walnuts to stain cars, sidewalks, porches, and patios, in addition to the hands of anyone attempting to shell them"
Juglans nigra,"
The brownish-black dye was used by early American settlers to dye hair"
Juglans nigra," According to Eastern Trees in the Petersen Guide series, black walnuts make a yellowish-brown dye, not brownish-black"
Juglans nigra," The apparent confusion is easily explained by the fact that the liquid (dye) obtained from the inner husk becomes increasingly darker over time, as the outer skin darkens from light green to black"
Juglans nigra," Extracts of the outer, soft part of the drupe are still used as a natural dye for handicrafts"
Juglans nigra,"
The tannins present in walnuts act as a mordant, aiding in the dyeing process, and are usable as a dark ink or wood stain"
Juglans nigra,"


=== Industrial ===
Walnut shells are often used as an abrasive in sand blasting or other circumstances where a medium hardness grit is required"
Juglans nigra," The hard black walnut shell is also used commercially in abrasive cleaning, a filtering agent in scrubbers in smoke stacks, cleaning jet engines, cosmetics, and oil well drilling and water filtration"
Juglans nigra,"


=== Wood ===

Black walnut is highly prized for its dark-colored, straight grained, true heartwood"
Juglans nigra," It is heavy, strong, shock resistant and yet can be easily split and worked"
Juglans nigra, Along with cedars (Thuja spp
Juglans nigra,"), chestnut (Castanea spp"
Juglans nigra,"), and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) black walnut is one of the most durable hardwoods in the US"
Juglans nigra," The wood can be kiln dried and holds its shape well after seasoning, which makes this wood even more attractive for wood working"
Juglans nigra,"Walnut wood has historically been used for gun stocks, furniture, flooring, paddles, coffins, and a variety of other wood products"
Juglans nigra," Due to its value, forestry officials often are called on to track down walnut poachers; in 2004, DNA testing was used to solve one such poaching case, involving a 55-foot (16-m) tree worth US$2,500"
Juglans nigra, Black walnut has a density of 660 kg per cubic meter (41
Juglans nigra,"2 lb/cubic foot), which makes it less dense than oak"
Juglans nigra,"


== Pests ==
Maggots (larvae of Rhagoletis completa and Rhagoletis suavis) in the husk are common, though more a nuisance than a serious problem for amateurs, who may simply remove the affected husk as soon as infestation is noticed"
Juglans nigra," The maggots develop entirely within the husk, thus the quality of the nutmeat is not affected"
Juglans nigra,"  However, infestations of maggots are undesirable because they make the husk difficult to remove and are unsightly"
Juglans nigra,"  Maggots can be serious for commercial walnut growers, who tend to use chemical treatments to prevent damage to the crop"
Juglans nigra,"  Some non-chemical controls also exist, such as removing and disposing of infested nuts"
Juglans nigra,The walnut weevil (Conotrachelus retentus) grows to  5 millimetres (3⁄16 in) long as an adult
Juglans nigra, The adult sucks plant juices through a snout
Juglans nigra,  The eggs are laid in fruits in the spring and summer
Juglans nigra," Many nuts are lost due to damage from the larvae, which burrow through the nut shell"
Juglans nigra,Black walnut is affected by European canker (Neonectria galligena)
Juglans nigra, The infection spreads slowly but infected trees eventually die
Juglans nigra,"The walnut caterpillar (Datana integerrima) and fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea) are two of the most serious pests, they commonly eat the foliage in midsummer and continue into autumn"
Juglans nigra,"
Codling moth (Cydia pomonella) larvae eat walnut kernels, as well as apple and pear seeds"
Juglans nigra,Important leaf sucking insects include species of aphids and plant lice including (Monellia spp
Juglans nigra, and Monelliopsis spp
Juglans nigra,"), which suck the juices from leaves and often deposit a sticky substance called ""honey-dew"" on the leaf surface that may turn black and prevent photosynthesis; and the walnut lace bug (Corythucha juglandis), which causes damage when the adults and nymphs suck the sap from the lower surfaces of walnut leaflets"
Juglans nigra,A disease complex known as thousand cankers disease has been threatening black walnut in several western states
Juglans nigra,"  This disease has recently been discovered in Tennessee, and could potentially have devastating effects on the species in the eastern United States"
Juglans nigra," Vectored by the walnut twig beetle (Pityophthorus juglandis), Geosmithia morbida spreads into the wood around the galleries carved by the small beetles"
Juglans nigra,"  The fungus causes cankers that inhibit the movement of nutrients in black walnut, leading to crown and branch dieback, and ultimately death"
Juglans nigra,"


== Allelopathy ==
Black walnut is allelopathic, as it excretes chemicals into its environment that harm competition"
Juglans nigra," While many species of plants are allelopathic, walnuts are particularly famous for it, records of walnut toxicity to other plants have been observed as far back as the first century when Pliny the Elder  wrote: ""The shadow of walnut trees is poison to all plants within its compass"
Juglans nigra,""" Walnuts have since been observed as being toxic to many plants including herbaceous and woody plants"
Juglans nigra,"
Like other walnuts, the roots, inner bark, nut husks, and leaves contain a nontoxic chemical called hydrojuglone, when exposed to air or soil compounds it is oxidized into juglone that is biologically active and acts as a respiratory inhibitor to some plants"
Juglans nigra, Juglone is poorly soluble in water and does not move far in the soil and will stay most concentrated in the soil directly beneath the tree
Juglans nigra, Even after a tree is removed the soil where the roots once were will still contain juglone for several years after the tree is removed as more juglone will be released as the roots decay
Juglans nigra, Well drained and aerated soils will host a healthy community of soil microbes and these microbes will help to break down the juglone
Juglans nigra,"
Symptoms of juglone poisoning include foliar yellowing and wilting"
Juglans nigra, A number of plants are particularly sensitive
Juglans nigra,"  Apples, tomatoes, pines, and birch are poisoned by juglone, and should not be planted in proximity to a black walnut"
Juglans nigra,"


== Interaction with horses ==
Horses are susceptible to laminitis from exposure to black walnut wood in bedding"
Juglans nigra,"


== Largest trees ==

The US national champion black walnut is on a residential property in Sauvie Island, Oregon"
Juglans nigra, It is 8 ft 7 in (2
Juglans nigra,"62 m) diameter at breast height and 112 ft (34 m) tall, with a crown spread of 144 feet (44 m)"
Juglans nigra,"The tallest black walnut in Europe is located in the Woluwe Park in the city of Sint-Pieters-Woluwe, Brussels, Belgium"
Juglans nigra, It has a circumference of 3
Juglans nigra,"50 m (11 ft 6 in), height of exactly 33"
Juglans nigra,60 m (110
Juglans nigra,"2 ft) (measured by laser), and was planted around 1850 (± 10 years)"
Juglans nigra,"The largest black walnut in Europe is located in the Castle Park in the city of Sereď, Slovakia"
Juglans nigra, It has a circumference of 6
Juglans nigra,"30 m (20 ft 8 in), height of 25 m (82 ft) and estimated age of 300 years"

Juniperus virginiana,"Juniperus virginiana, known as red cedar, eastern redcedar, Virginian juniper, eastern juniper, red juniper, pencil cedar, and aromatic cedar, is a species of juniper native to eastern North America from southeastern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and east of the Great Plains"
Juniperus virginiana, Further west it is replaced by the related Juniperus scopulorum (Rocky Mountain juniper) and to the southwest by Juniperus ashei (Ashe juniper)
Juniperus virginiana,"


== Description ==

Juniperus virginiana is a dense slow-growing coniferous evergreen tree that may never become more than a bush on poor soil, but is ordinarily from 5–20 m or 16–66 ft tall, with a short trunk 30–100 cm or 12–39 inches in diameter (rarely to 27 m or 89 ft in height, and 170 cm or 67 inches in diameter"
Juniperus virginiana," The oldest tree reported, from West Virginia, was 940 years old"
Juniperus virginiana," The bark is reddish-brown, fibrous, and peels off in narrow strips"
Juniperus virginiana," The leaves are of two types; sharp, spreading needle-like juvenile leaves 5–10 mm (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, and tightly adpressed scale-like adult leaves 2–4 mm (1⁄16–3⁄16 in) long; they are arranged in opposite decussate pairs or occasionally whorls of three"
Juniperus virginiana," The juvenile leaves are found on young plants up to 3 years old, and as scattered shoots on adult trees, usually in shade"
Juniperus virginiana," The seed cones are 3–7 mm (1⁄8–1⁄4 in) long, berry-like, dark purple-blue with a white wax cover giving an overall sky-blue color (though the wax often rubs off); they contain one to three (rarely up to four) seeds, and are mature in 6–8 months from pollination"
Juniperus virginiana," The juniper berry is an important winter food for many birds, which disperse the wingless seeds"
Juniperus virginiana, The pollen cones are 2–3 mm (1⁄16–1⁄8 in) long and 1
Juniperus virginiana,"5 mm (1⁄16 in) broad, shedding pollen in late winter or early spring"
Juniperus virginiana," The trees are usually dioecious, with pollen and seed cones on separate trees"
Juniperus virginiana,"There are two varieties, which intergrade where they meet:
Juniperus virginiana var"
Juniperus virginiana, virginiana is called eastern juniper / redcedar
Juniperus virginiana," It is found in eastern North America, from Maine, west to southern Ontario and South Dakota, south to northernmost Florida and southwest into the post oak savannah of east-central Texas"
Juniperus virginiana," Cones are larger, 4–7 mm (3⁄16–1⁄4 in); scale leaves are acute at apex and bark is red-brown"
Juniperus virginiana,"

Juniperus virginiana, silicicola (Small) E
Juniperus virginiana,Murray (syn
Juniperus virginiana," Sabina silicicola Small, Juniperus silicicola (Small) L"
Juniperus virginiana,H
Juniperus virginiana,Bailey) is known as southern or sand juniper / redcedar
Juniperus virginiana," Its variety name means ""flint-dweller"", from Latin silex and -cola"
Juniperus virginiana," Habitat is along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from the extreme southeastern corner of Virginia, south to central Florida and west to southeast Texas"
Juniperus virginiana," Cones are smaller, 3–4 mm (1⁄8–3⁄16 in); scale leaves are blunt at apex and the bark is orange-brown"
Juniperus virginiana," It is treated by some authors at the lower rank of variety, while others treat it as a distinct species"
Juniperus virginiana,"


== Ecology ==

Eastern juniper is a pioneer species, which means that it is one of the first trees to repopulate cleared, eroded, or otherwise damaged land"
Juniperus virginiana," It is unusually long lived among pioneer species, with the potential to live over 900 years"
Juniperus virginiana," It is commonly found in prairies or oak barrens, old pastures, or limestone hills, often along highways and near recent construction sites"
Juniperus virginiana," It is an alternate host for cedar–apple rust, an economically significant fungal disease of apples, and some management strategies recommend the removal of J"
Juniperus virginiana," virginiana near apple orchardsIn many areas it is considered an invasive species, even if native"
Juniperus virginiana," It is fire-intolerant, and was previously controlled by periodic wildfires"
Juniperus virginiana, Low branches near the ground burn and provide a ladder that allows fire to engulf the whole tree
Juniperus virginiana, Grasses recover quickly from low severity fires that are characteristic of prairies that kept the trees at bay
Juniperus virginiana," With the urbanization of prairies, the fires have been stopped with roads, plowed fields, and other fire breaks, allowing J"
Juniperus virginiana, virginiana and other trees to invade
Juniperus virginiana," Trees are destructive to grasslands if left unchecked, and are actively being eliminated by cutting and prescribed burning"
Juniperus virginiana," The trees also burn very readily, and dense populations were blamed for the rapid spread of wildfires in drought stricken Oklahoma and Texas in 2005 and 2006"
Juniperus virginiana,"Eastern juniper benefits from increased CO2 levels, unlike the grasses with which it competes"
Juniperus virginiana," Many grasses are C4 plants that concentrate CO2 levels in their bundle sheaths to increase the efficiency of RuBisCO, the enzyme responsible for photosynthesis, while junipers are C3 plants that rely on (and may benefit from) the natural CO2 concentrations of the environment, although they are less efficient at fixing CO2 in general"
Juniperus virginiana,Damage done by J
Juniperus virginiana, virginiana includes outcompeting forage species in pastureland
Juniperus virginiana, The low branches and wide base occupy a significant portion of land area
Juniperus virginiana," The thick foliage blocks out most light, so few plants can live under the canopy"
Juniperus virginiana," The needles that fall raise the pH of the soil, making it alkaline, which holds nutrients such as phosphorus, making it harder for plants to absorb them"
Juniperus virginiana," However, studies have found that Juniperus virginiana forests that replace grasslands have a statistically insignificant decrease to a significant increase in levels of soil nitrogen"
Juniperus virginiana, J
Juniperus virginiana," virginiana forests have higher overall nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), despite the common grassland species Andropogon gerardi having a far higher NUE during photosynthesis (PNUE)"
Juniperus virginiana," The forests store much greater amounts of carbon in both biomass and soil, with most of the additional carbon stored aboveground"
Juniperus virginiana, There is no significant difference in soil microbial activity
Juniperus virginiana,"Cedar waxwings are fond of the ""berries"" of these junipers"
Juniperus virginiana," It takes about 12 minutes for their seeds to pass through the birds' guts, and seeds that have been consumed by this bird have levels of germination roughly three times higher than those of seeds the birds did not eat"
Juniperus virginiana, Many other birds (from bluebirds to turkeys) and many mammals also consume them
Juniperus virginiana,"


== Uses ==

The fine-grained, soft brittle pinkish- to brownish-red heartwood is fragrant, very light and very durable, even in contact with soil"
Juniperus virginiana," Because of its rot resistance, the wood is used for fence posts"
Juniperus virginiana," The aromatic wood is avoided by moths, so it is in demand as lining for clothes chests and closets, often referred to as cedar closets and cedar chests"
Juniperus virginiana," If correctly prepared, it makes excellent English longbows, flatbows, and Native American sinew-backed bows"
Juniperus virginiana," The wood is marketed as ""eastern redcedar"" or ""aromatic cedar"""
Juniperus virginiana," The best portions of the heartwood are one of the few woods good for making pencils, but the supply had diminished sufficiently by the 1940s that it was largely replaced by incense-cedar"

Liquidambar styraciflua," Sweet gum is one of the main valuable forest trees in the southeastern United States, and is a popular ornamental tree in temperate climates"
Liquidambar styraciflua," It is recognizable by the combination of its five-pointed star-shaped leaves and its hard, spiked fruits"
Liquidambar styraciflua," It is currently classified in the plant family Altingiaceae, but was formerly considered a member of the Hamamelidaceae"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"


== Names ==
This plant's genus name Liquidambar was first given by Linnaeus in 1753 from [the Latin] liquidus, fluid, and the Arabic ambar, amber, in allusion to the fragrant terebinthine juice or gum which exudes from the tree"
Liquidambar styraciflua," Its specific epithet styraciflua is an old generic name meaning ""flowing with storax"" (a plant resin)"
Liquidambar styraciflua," The name ""storax"" has long been confusingly applied to the aromatic gum or resin of this species, that of L"
Liquidambar styraciflua," orientalis of Turkey, and to the resin better known as benzoin from various tropical trees in the genus Styrax"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"
The sweetgum has a Nahuatl name, Ocotzocuahuitl, which translates to tree that gives pine resin from ocotl (pine), tzotl (resin), cuahuitl (tree), which refers to the use of the tree's resin"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"The common name ""sweet gum"" refers to the species' ""sweetish gum"", contrasting with the black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), only distantly related, with which the sweet gum overlaps broadly in range"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"  The species is also known as the ""red gum"", for its reddish bark"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"


== History ==
The earliest known published record of Liquidambar styraciflua is in a work by Spanish naturalist Francisco Hernández published posthumously in 1615, in which he describes the species as a large tree producing a fragrant gum resembling liquid amber, whence the genus name Liquidambar"
Liquidambar styraciflua, In John Ray's Historia Plantarum (1686) it is called Styrax liquida
Liquidambar styraciflua," However, the first mention of any use of the amber is described by Juan de Grijalva, the nephew of the governor of Cuba, in the year 1517"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"
Juan de Grijalva tells of gift exchanges with the Mayas ""who presented them with, among other things, hollow reeds of about a span long filled with dried herbs and sweet-smelling liquid amber which, when lighted in the way shown by the natives, diffused an agreeable odour"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"""
The species was introduced into Europe in 1681 by John Banister, the missionary collector sent out by Bishop Compton, who planted it in the palace gardens at Fulham in London, England"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"


=== Fossil record ===
An ancestor of Liquidambar styraciflua is known from Tertiary-aged fossils in Alaska, Greenland, and the mid-continental plateau of North America, much further north than Liquidambar now grows"
Liquidambar styraciflua,  A similar plant is also found in Miocene deposits of the Tertiary of Europe
Liquidambar styraciflua,"


== Distribution ==
Sweetgum is one of the most common hardwoods in the southeastern United States, where it occurs naturally in lowlands from southwestern Connecticut south to central Florida, through central Ohio and west to Illinois, southern Missouri, and eastern Texas, but not colder highland areas of Appalachia or the Midwestern states"
Liquidambar styraciflua," The species also occurs in Mexico from southern Nuevo León south to Chiapas, as well as in Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras"
Liquidambar styraciflua," In Mexico and Central America, it is a characteristic plant of cloud forests, growing at middle elevations in various mountainous areas where the climate is humid and more temperate"
Liquidambar styraciflua,The US government distribution maps for this species are incorrect concerning the southern limit of distribution in Florida
Liquidambar styraciflua," This species occurs abundantly at Highlands Hammock State Park, Sebring, Highlands County, FL, and even southwest of Lake Okeechobee"

Liquidambar styraciflua,"91 m) in diameter, on average"
Liquidambar styraciflua,  Trees may live to 400 years
Liquidambar styraciflua, The tree is a symmetrical shape and crowns into an egg shape when the branches get too heavy after its first two years of cultivation
Liquidambar styraciflua,"


=== Bark and branches ===
Another distinctive feature of the tree is the peculiar appearance of its small branches and twigs"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"  The bark attaches itself to these in plates edgewise instead of laterally, and a piece of the leafless branch with the aid of a little imagination readily takes on a reptilian form; indeed, the tree is sometimes called ""alligatorwood"""
Liquidambar styraciflua,"
The bark is a light brown tinged with red and sometimes gray with dark streaks and weighs 37 lbs"
Liquidambar styraciflua, per cubic foot
Liquidambar styraciflua,  It is deeply fissured with scaly ridges
Liquidambar styraciflua, The branches carry layers of cork
Liquidambar styraciflua,"   The branchlets are pithy, many-angled, winged, and at first covered with rusty hairs, finally becoming red brown, gray or dark brown"
Liquidambar styraciflua," As an ornamental tree, the species has a drawback—the branches may have ridges or ""wings"" that cause more surface area, increasing weight of snow and ice accumulation on the tree"

Liquidambar styraciflua,"  Its reds and yellows compare to that of the maples (Acer), and in addition it has the dark purples and smoky browns of the ash (Fraxinus)"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"  However, in the northern part of its range, and where planted in yet colder areas, the leaves are often killed by frost while still green"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"  On the other hand, in the extreme southern or tropical parts of its range, some trees are evergreen or semi-evergreen, with negligible fall color"
Liquidambar styraciflua, The leaves are three to seven inches broad with glandular serrate teeth
Liquidambar styraciflua,  The base is truncate or slightly heart-shaped
Liquidambar styraciflua,"  They come out of the bud plicate, downy, pale green, when full grown are bright green, smooth, shining above, paler beneath"
Liquidambar styraciflua, They contain tannin and when bruised give a resinous fragrance
Liquidambar styraciflua,"While the starry five-pointed leaves of Liquidambar resemble those of some maples (Acer), Liquidambar is easily distinguished from Acer by its glossy, leathery leaves that are positioned singly (alternate), not in pairs (opposite) on the stems"

Liquidambar styraciflua,  Stamens indefinite; filaments short; anthers introrse
Liquidambar styraciflua,"  Pistillate flowers with a two-celled, two-beaked ovary, the carpels produced into a long, recurved, persistent style"
Liquidambar styraciflua,  The ovaries all more or less cohere and harden in fruit
Liquidambar styraciflua,  There are many ovules but few mature
Liquidambar styraciflua,"


=== Fruit ===
The distinctive compound fruit is hard, dry, and globose,1–1"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"5 inches (25–38 mm) in diameter, composed of numerous (40–60) capsules"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"  Each capsule, containing one to two small seeds, has a pair of terminal spikes (for a total of 80–120 spikes)"
Liquidambar styraciflua," When the fruit opens and the seeds are released, each capsule is associated with a small hole (40–60 of these) in the compound fruit"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"
Fallen, opened fruits are often abundant beneath the trees; these have been popularly nicknamed ""burr (or bir) balls"", ""gum balls"", ""space bugs"", ""sticker balls"", or ""spike balls"""
Liquidambar styraciflua,"
The fruit is a multicapsular spherical head and hangs on the branches during the winter"
Liquidambar styraciflua,  The woody capsules are mostly filled with abortive seeds resembling sawdust
Liquidambar styraciflua," The seeds are about one-quarter of an inch thick, winged, and wind-dispersed"
Liquidambar styraciflua," Goldfinches, purple finches, squirrels, and chipmunks eat the seeds of the tree"
Liquidambar styraciflua,  The seeds stratify within 30–90 days at 33°–41 °F or soaked in water for 15–20 days
Liquidambar styraciflua,"
The long-stemmed fruit balls of Liquidambar resemble those of the American sycamore or buttonwood (Platanus occidentalis), but are spiny and remain intact after their seeds are dispersed;  the softer fruits of Platanus disintegrate upon seed dispersal"
Liquidambar styraciflua, The long-persisting fallen spiked fruits can be unpleasant to walk on;  sweet gum is banned in some places for this reason
Liquidambar styraciflua,"  In abundance, they can leave a lawn lumpy"
Liquidambar styraciflua," The winter buds are yellow brown, one-fourth of an inch long, acute"
Liquidambar styraciflua,"  The inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, becoming half an inch long, green tipped with red"

Maclura pomifera," Staminate flowers are pale green, small, and arranged in racemes borne on long, slender, drooping peduncles developed from the axils of crowded leaves on the spur-like branchlets of the previous year"
Maclura pomifera," They feature a hairy, four-lobed calyx; the four stamens are inserted opposite the lobes of calyx, on the margin of a thin disk"
Maclura pomifera, Pistillate flowers are borne in a dense spherical many-flowered head which appears on a short stout peduncle from the axils of the current year's growth
Maclura pomifera," Each flower has a hairy four-lobed calyx with thick, concave lobes that invest the ovary and enclose the fruit"
Maclura pomifera," Ovaries are superior, ovate, compressed, green, and crowned by a long slender style covered with white stigmatic hairs"

== Distribution ==

Osage orange's pre-Columbian range was largely restricted to a small area in what is now the United States, namely the Red River drainage of Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, as well as the Blackland Prairies and post oak savannas"
Maclura pomifera, A disjunct population also occurred in the Chisos Mountains of Texas
Maclura pomifera," It has since become widely naturalized in the United States and Ontario, Canada"
Maclura pomifera, Osage orange has been planted in all the 48 contiguous states of the United States and in southeastern Canada
Maclura pomifera,"The largest known Osage orange tree is located at River Farm, in Alexandria, Virginia, and is believed to have been a gift from Thomas Jefferson"
Maclura pomifera," Another historic tree is located on the grounds of Fort Harrod, a Kentucky pioneer settlement in Harrodsburg, Kentucky"
Maclura pomifera,"


=== Ecological aspects of historical distribution ===
The natural mechanism of seed dispersal for Osage orange, and the reason for its limited historical range despite its adaptability, has been the subject of debate"
Maclura pomifera, One hypothesis is that the Osage orange fruit was eaten by a giant ground sloth that became extinct shortly after the first human settlement of North America
Maclura pomifera," Other extinct Pleistocene megafauna, such as the mammoth, mastodon and gomphothere, may have fed on the fruit and aided in seed dispersal"
Maclura pomifera, An equine species that became extinct at the same time also has been suggested as the plant's original dispersal agent because modern horses and other livestock will sometimes eat the fruit
Maclura pomifera," However, a 2015 study indicated that Osage orange seeds are not effectively spread by horses or elephant species"
Maclura pomifera,"The fruit is not poisonous to humans or livestock, but is not preferred by them because it is mostly inedible due to a large size (about the diameter of a softball), and hard, dry texture"
Maclura pomifera, The edible seeds of the fruit are used by squirrels as food
Maclura pomifera," Large animals such as livestock, which typically would consume fruits and disperse seeds, mainly ignore the fruit"
Maclura pomifera,"


== Ecology ==
The fruits are consumed by black-tailed deer in Texas and fox squirrels in the Midwest, who drop them to crack open"
Maclura pomifera, Crossbills are said to peck the seeds out
Maclura pomifera,"


== Cultivation ==
Maclura pomifera prefers a deep and fertile soil, but is hardy over most of the contiguous United States, where it is used as a hedge"
Maclura pomifera," It must be regularly pruned to keep it in bounds, and the shoots of a single year will grow one to two metres (3–6 ft) long, making it suitable for coppicing"
Maclura pomifera, A neglected hedge will become fruit-bearing
Maclura pomifera, It is remarkably free from insect predators and fungal diseases
Maclura pomifera,  A thornless male cultivar of the species exists and is vegetatively reproduced for ornamental use
Maclura pomifera, M
Maclura pomifera," pomifera is cultivated in Italy, former Yugoslavia, Romania, former USSR, and India"
Maclura pomifera,"


== Chemistry ==
Osajin and pomiferin are isoflavones present in the wood and fruit in an approximately 1:2 ratio by weight, and in turn comprise 4-6% of the weight of dry fruit and wood samples"
Maclura pomifera," Primary components of fresh fruit include pectin (46%), resin (17%), fat (5%), and sugar (before hydrolysis, 5%)"
Maclura pomifera, The moisture content of fresh fruits is about 80%
Maclura pomifera,"


== Uses ==

The Osage orange is commonly used as a tree row windbreak in prairie states, which gives it one of its colloquial names, ""hedge apple"""
Maclura pomifera," It was one of the primary trees used in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's ""Great Plains Shelterbelt"" WPA project, which was launched in 1934 as an ambitious plan to modify weather and prevent soil erosion in the Great Plains states, and by 1942 resulted in the planting of 30,233 shelterbelts containing 220 million trees that stretched for 18,600 miles (29,900 km)"
Maclura pomifera, The sharp-thorned trees were also planted as cattle-deterring hedges before the introduction of barbed wire and afterward became an important source of fence posts
Maclura pomifera," In 2001, its wood was used in the construction in Chestertown, Maryland of the Schooner Sultana, a replica of HMS Sultana"
Maclura pomifera,"The heavy, close-grained yellow-orange wood is dense and prized for tool handles, treenails, fence posts, and other applications requiring a strong dimensionally stable wood that withstands rot"
Maclura pomifera," Although its wood is commonly knotty and twisted, straight-grained Osage orange timber makes good bows, as once used by Native Americans"
Maclura pomifera," John Bradbury, a Scottish botanist who had traveled the interior United States extensively in the early 19th century, reported that a bow made of Osage timber could be traded for a horse and a blanket"
Maclura pomifera," Additionally, a yellow-orange dye can be extracted from the wood, which can be used as a substitute for fustic and aniline dyes"
Maclura pomifera," At present, florists use the fruits of M"
Maclura pomifera, pomifera for decorative purposes
Maclura pomifera,"When dried, the wood has the highest BTU content of any commonly available North American wood, and burns long and hot"
Maclura pomifera,"Unlike many woods, Osage orange wood is durable, making good fence posts"
Maclura pomifera, They are generally set up green because the dried wood is too hard to reliably accept the staples used to attach the fencing to the posts
Maclura pomifera," Palmer and Fowler's Fieldbook of Natural History 2nd edition, rates Osage orange wood as being at least twice as hard and strong as white oak (Quercus alba)"
Maclura pomifera, Its dense grain structure makes for good tonal properties
Maclura pomifera, Production of woodwind instruments and waterfowl game calls are common uses for the wood
Maclura pomifera,A chemistry professor at the University of Alabama claimed that a single osage orange placed in a room would drive away cockroaches
Maclura pomifera," Research has shown that compounds extracted from the fruit, when concentrated, may repel insects"
Maclura pomifera," However, the naturally occurring concentrations of these compounds in the fruit are far too low to make the fruit an effective insect repellent"
Maclura pomifera," In 2004, the EPA insisted that a website selling M"

Pinus flexilis, It is also called Rocky Mountain white pine
Pinus flexilis,"
A limber pine in Eagle Cap Wilderness, Oregon has been documented as over 2000 years old, and another one was confirmed at 1140 years old"
Pinus flexilis,"  Another candidate for the oldest limber pine was identified in 2006 near the Alta Ski Area in Utah; called ""Twister"", the tree was confirmed to be at least 1700 years old and thought to be even older"
Pinus flexilis,"


== Distribution ==
The largest part of the limber pine's range is in the Rocky Mountains, from southwest Alberta and southeastern British Columbia south through Colorado and New Mexico into the northern states of Mexico"
Pinus flexilis," It is also found through the Great Basin states of Nevada and Utah, in the eastern Sierra Nevada and White Mountains of Northern California, and in the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California"
Pinus flexilis," Continuing south the species is found in the San Jacinto Mountains, Santa Rosa Mountains, and Hot Springs Mountain of the Peninsular Ranges"
Pinus flexilis," There are small disjunct populations in eastern Washington and Oregon, in western North Dakota and Nebraska, and in the Black Hills of South Dakota"
Pinus flexilis," It is found at a wide range of altitudes depending on the latitude, from 850 to 3,810 metres (2,790 to 12,500 ft)"
Pinus flexilis," In the northern half of its range, it grows in the montane zone near the lower tree line; in the middle of its range between the 45th and 40th parallels, it grows on windswept sites in the montane and subalpine zones; and in the southern part of its range, it grows mainly at high elevations in the subalpine zone near the upper tree line"
Pinus flexilis,"


== Description ==
Its pliant branches gives it the common name ""limber"" and specific epithet flexilis"
Pinus flexilis," Its long needles are a dark, blueish green, its bark is heavily creased and dark grey"
Pinus flexilis, Its pale wood is lightweight and soft
Pinus flexilis,"
Pinus flexilis is typically a high-elevation pine, often marking the tree line either on its own, or with whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), either of the bristlecone pines, or lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta)"
Pinus flexilis," In favourable conditions, it makes a tree to 20 meters (65 ft), rarely 25 meters (80 ft) tall"

Pinus flexilis," Squirrels, Northern flickers, and mountain bluebirds often nest in the trees"
Pinus flexilis, There is some evidence that P
Pinus flexilis, flexilis has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that inhabit the needles
Pinus flexilis,"


== Related species ==
Pinus flexilis is a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath"
Pinus flexilis," This distinguishes it from the lodgepole pine, with two needles per fascicle, and the bristlecone pines, which share five needles per fascicle but have a semi-persistent sheath"
Pinus flexilis,"


=== Pinus albicaulis ===
Distinguishing limber pine from the related whitebark pine (P"
Pinus flexilis," albicaulis), also a white pine, is very much more difficult, and can only easily be done by the cones"
Pinus flexilis," In limber pine, the cones are 6–12 centimeters (2 1⁄4–4 3⁄4 in) long where the species overlap, green when immature, and open to release the seeds; the scales are not fragile"
Pinus flexilis," In whitebark pine, the cones are 4–7 centimeters (1 1⁄2–2 3⁄4 in) long, dark purple when immature, and do not open on drying, but are fragile and are pulled apart by birds (see below) to release the seeds"
Pinus flexilis," A useful clue is that whitebark pines almost never have intact old cones lying under them, whereas limber pines usually do"
Pinus flexilis,"


=== Pinus monticola ===
In the absence of cones, limber pine can also be hard to tell from Western white pine (P"
Pinus flexilis, monticola) where they occur together in the northern Rockies and the Sierra Nevada east slope
Pinus flexilis," The most useful clue here is that limber pine needles are entire (smooth when rubbed gently in both directions), whereas Western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base)"
Pinus flexilis," Limber pine needles are also usually shorter, 4–7 centimeters (1 1⁄2–2 3⁄4 in) long, while western white pine needles are 5–10 centimeters (2–4 in), though the ranges overlap"
Pinus flexilis,"


== Diseases ==
Limber pine is susceptible to white pine blister rust, caused by Cronartium ribicola, a fungus that was introduced accidentally from Europe"
Pinus flexilis," Limber pine mortality is high in many areas throughout its range, except Arizona, where it has not yet been found"
Pinus flexilis," However, there is little hope of controlling the blister rust in existing trees"
Pinus flexilis," Research is under way, locating and breeding from the occasional naturally resistant limber pines, and by studying the resistance mechanisms of the European and Asian white pines (e"

Pinus strobus,2 m × 1
Pinus strobus,2 m (4 ft × 4 ft) by 76 cm (30 in) on its ends
Pinus strobus,"
Marking of large specimens by the Crown was very controversial in the colonies, leading to the Pine Tree Riot in 1772; its act of rebellion played a significant role in the events leading to the American Revolution"

Platanus acerifolia,"Platanus × acerifolia, the London plane, London planetree, or hybrid plane, is a tree in the genus Platanus"
Platanus acerifolia, It is often known by the synonym Platanus × hispanica
Platanus acerifolia, It is usually thought to be a hybrid of Platanus orientalis (oriental plane) and Platanus occidentalis (American sycamore)
Platanus acerifolia, Some authorities think that it may be a cultivar of P
Platanus acerifolia, orientalis
Platanus acerifolia,"


== Description ==

The London plane is a large deciduous tree growing 20–30 m (66–98 ft), exceptionally over 40 m (131 ft) tall, with a trunk up to 3 m (10 ft) or more in circumference"
Platanus acerifolia," The bark is usually pale grey-green, smooth and exfoliating, or buff-brown and not exfoliating"
Platanus acerifolia," The leaves are thick and stiff-textured, broad, palmately lobed, superficially maple-like, the leaf blade 10–20 cm (4–8 in) long and 12–25 cm (5–10 in) broad, with a petiole 3–10 cm (1–4 in) long"
Platanus acerifolia," The young leaves in spring are coated with minute, fine, stiff hairs at first, but these wear off and by late summer the leaves are hairless or nearly so"
Platanus acerifolia," The flowers are borne in one to three (most often two) dense spherical inflorescences on a pendulous stem, with male and female flowers on separate stems"
Platanus acerifolia," The fruit matures in about 6 months, to 2–3 cm diameter, and comprises a dense spherical cluster of achenes with numerous stiff hairs which aid wind dispersal; the cluster breaks up slowly over the winter to release the numerous 2–3 mm seeds"
Platanus acerifolia, The London Plane is one of the most efficient trees in removing small particulate pollutants in urban areas
Platanus acerifolia,"It shares many visual similarities with Platanus occidentalis (American sycamore), from which it is derived; however, the two species are relatively easy to distinguish, considering the London plane is almost exclusively planted in urban habitats, while P"
Platanus acerifolia, occidentalis is most commonly found growing in lowlands and alluvial soils along streams
Platanus acerifolia,"


== Origin ==

The species was formed by hybridization in the 17th century after P"
Platanus acerifolia, orientalis and P
Platanus acerifolia, occidentalis had been planted in proximity to one another
Platanus acerifolia," It is often said that the hybridization took place in Spain, but it could also have happened in Vauxhall Gardens in London where John Tradescant the Younger discovered the tree in the mid-17th century"
Platanus acerifolia,"
The leaf and flower characteristics are intermediate between the two parent species, the leaf being more deeply lobed than P"
Platanus acerifolia, occidentalis but less so than P
Platanus acerifolia," orientalis, and the seed balls typically two per stem (one in P"
Platanus acerifolia," occidentalis, 3–6 in P"
Platanus acerifolia, orientalis)
Platanus acerifolia," The hybrid is fertile, and seedlings are occasionally found near mature trees"
Platanus acerifolia,"
Controlled reciprocal pollinations between P"
Platanus acerifolia, occidentalis and P
Platanus acerifolia, orientalis resulted in good yields of germinable seed and true hybrid seedlings
Platanus acerifolia," Crosses of both species, as females, with P"
Platanus acerifolia, racemosa and P
Platanus acerifolia," wrightii produced extremely low yields of germinable seed, but true hybrids were obtained from all interspecific combinations"
Platanus acerifolia, Apomixis (asexual reproduction from non-fertilized seeds) appeared common in P
Platanus acerifolia, orientalis
Platanus acerifolia,"In 1968 and 1970, Frank S"
Platanus acerifolia, Santamour Jr
Platanus acerifolia, recreated the P
Platanus acerifolia, orientalis by P
Platanus acerifolia, occidentalis cross using a P
Platanus acerifolia, orientalis of Turkish origin with American sycamores (P
Platanus acerifolia, occidentalis)
Platanus acerifolia, The offspring were evaluated following several years of exposure to anthracnose infection
Platanus acerifolia," Two selections, 'Columbia' and 'Liberty', were released in August, 1984"
Platanus acerifolia,"


== Taxonomy ==

Platanus × acerifolia was first formally described in the botanical literature by the Scottish botanist William Aiton in his 1789 work Hortus Kewensis as a variety of P"
Platanus acerifolia, orientalis
Platanus acerifolia," Aiton described this variety with a two-word Latin diagnosis, ""foliis transversis"", and called it the Spanish plane tree"
Platanus acerifolia," In 1805, Carl Ludwig Willdenow chose to elevate Aiton's variety to species rank, publishing the new species P"
Platanus acerifolia, acerifolia in the fourth edition of Species Plantarum
Platanus acerifolia, The species name was then modified to include the multiplication symbol to indicate its suspected hybrid parentage

Platanus acerifolia,", is a nomen dubium based on an uncertain description"
Platanus acerifolia,"


== Cultivation ==
The London plane is one of 50 Great British Trees that the Tree Council selected in 2002 in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee"
Platanus acerifolia," The list specifically mentions Britain's first London plane being in the city of Ely, Cambridgeshire"
Platanus acerifolia,"
The London plane is very tolerant of atmospheric pollution and root compaction, and for this reason it is a popular urban roadside tree"
Platanus acerifolia, It was planted extensively in Victorian times to weather the pollution of London
Platanus acerifolia," It is now extensively cultivated in most temperate latitudes as an ornamental and parkland tree, and is a commonly planted tree in cities throughout the temperate regions of the world, in London and many other cities"
Platanus acerifolia, It has a greater degree of winter cold tolerance than P
Platanus acerifolia," orientalis, and is less susceptible to anthracnose disease than P"
Platanus acerifolia, occidentalis
Platanus acerifolia," Under the synonym Platanus × hispanica, the tree has gained the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain's Award of Garden Merit"
Platanus acerifolia,The tree is fairly wind-resistant
Platanus acerifolia," However, it has a number of problems in urban use, most notably the short, stiff hairs shed by the young leaves and the dispersing seeds; these are an irritant if breathed in, and can exacerbate breathing difficulties for people with asthma"
Platanus acerifolia," The large leaves can create a disposal problem in cities, as they are tough and sometimes can take more than one year to break down if they remain whole"
Platanus acerifolia,"
London planes are often pruned by a technique called pollarding"
Platanus acerifolia," A pollarded tree has a drastically different appearance than an unpruned tree, being much shorter with stunted, club-like branches"
Platanus acerifolia," Although pollarding requires frequent maintenance (the trees must usually be repruned every year), it creates a distinctive shape that is often sought after in plazas, main streets, and other urban areas"
Platanus acerifolia,"

		


=== In New York City ===
According to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation the symbol of that organization is a cross between the leaf of the London plane and a maple leaf"
Platanus acerifolia, It is prominently featured on signs and buildings in public parks across the city
Platanus acerifolia, The tree is on the NYC Parks Department's list of restricted use species for street tree planting because it constitutes more than 10% of all street trees
Platanus acerifolia,"


=== In Australia ===
In Australia, the London plane is used extensively as a street tree in major cities, particularly Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth"
Platanus acerifolia," The tree is commonly used because of its resilience to warm weather, its benefits as a shade tree, resistance to breakage and tolerance of urban pollution"
Platanus acerifolia,"


=== In Johannesburg, South Africa ===
In Johannesburg, South Africa many London planes line streets in older suburbs"
Platanus acerifolia, In recent years the trees have been infested with the Polyphagous shot hole borer beetle
Platanus acerifolia, There is currently no way to save the trees and the city have resorted to cutting down the trees

Platanus occidentalis,"Platanus occidentalis, also known as American sycamore, American planetree, western plane, occidental plane, buttonwood, and water beech, is a species of Platanus native to the eastern and central United States, the mountains of northeastern Mexico, extreme southern Ontario, and possibly extreme southern Quebec"
Platanus occidentalis," It is usually called sycamore in North America, a name which can refer to other types of tree in other parts of the world"
Platanus occidentalis,"
The species epithet occidentalis is Latin for ""western"", referring to the Western Hemisphere, because at the time when it was named by Carl Linnaeus, the only other species in the genus was P"
Platanus occidentalis," orientalis (""eastern""), native to the Eastern Hemisphere"
Platanus occidentalis,"


== Description ==
An American sycamore tree can often be easily distinguished from other trees by its mottled bark which flakes off in great irregular masses, leaving the surface mottled and gray, greenish-white and brown"
Platanus occidentalis," The bark of all trees has to yield to a growing trunk by stretching, splitting, or infilling"
Platanus occidentalis, The sycamore shows the process more openly than many other trees
Platanus occidentalis," The explanation is found in the rigid texture of the bark tissue which lacks the elasticity of the bark of some other trees, so it is incapable of stretching to accommodate the growth of the wood underneath, so the tree sloughs it off"
Platanus occidentalis,"A sycamore can grow to massive proportions, typically reaching up to 30 to 40 m (98 to 131 ft) high and 1"
Platanus occidentalis,5 to 2 m (4
Platanus occidentalis,9 to 6

Platanus occidentalis, Larger specimens were recorded in historical times
Platanus occidentalis," In 1744, a Shenandoah Valley settler named Joseph Hampton and two sons lived for most of the year in a hollow sycamore in what is now Clarke County, Virginia"
Platanus occidentalis," In 1770, at Point Pleasant, Virginia (now in West Virginia) near the junction of the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers, George Washington recorded in his journal a sycamore measuring 13"
Platanus occidentalis,67 m (44 ft 10 in) in circumference at 91 cm (3 ft) from the ground
Platanus occidentalis,"The sycamore tree is often divided near the ground into several secondary trunks, very free from branches"
Platanus occidentalis,"  Spreading limbs at the top make an irregular, open head"
Platanus occidentalis, Roots are fibrous
Platanus occidentalis, The trunks of large trees are often hollow
Platanus occidentalis,"
Another peculiarity is the way the leaves grow sticky, green buds"
Platanus occidentalis," In early August, most trees in general will have—nestled in the axils of their leaves—the tiny forming bud which will produce the leaves of the coming year"
Platanus occidentalis, The sycamore branch apparently has no such buds
Platanus occidentalis, Instead there is an enlargement of the petiole which encloses the bud in a tight-fitting case at the base of the petiole
Platanus occidentalis,"
Bark: Dark reddish brown, broken into oblong plate-like scales; higher on the tree, it is smooth and light gray; separates freely into thin plates which peel off and leave the surface pale yellow, or white, or greenish"
Platanus occidentalis," Branchlets at first pale green, coated with thick pale tomentum, later dark green and smooth, finally become light gray or light reddish brown"
Platanus occidentalis,"
Wood: Light brown, tinged with red; heavy, weak, difficult to split"

Platanus occidentalis,"
Leaves: Alternate, palmately nerved, broadly ovate or orbicular, 10 to 23 cm (4 to 9 in) inches long, truncate or cordate or wedge-shaped at base, decurrent on the petiole"
Platanus occidentalis," Three to five-lobed by broad shallow sinuses rounded in the bottom; lobes acuminate, toothed, or entire, or undulate"
Platanus occidentalis," They come out of the bud plicate, pale green coated with pale tomentum; when full grown are bright yellow green above, paler beneath"
Platanus occidentalis, In autumn they turn brown and wither before falling
Platanus occidentalis," Petioles long, abruptly enlarged at base and inclosing the buds"
Platanus occidentalis," Stipules with spreading, toothed borders, conspicuous on young shoots, caducous"
Platanus occidentalis,"
Flowers: May, with the leaves; monoecious, borne in dense heads"
Platanus occidentalis, Staminate and pistillate heads on separate peduncles
Platanus occidentalis," Staminate heads dark red, on axillary peduncles; pistillate heads light green tinged with red, on longer terminal peduncles"
Platanus occidentalis," Calyx of staminate flowers three to six tiny scale-like sepals, slightly united at the base, half as long as the pointed petals"

== Distribution ==
In its native range, it is often found in riparian and wetland areas"
Platanus occidentalis," The range extends from Iowa to Ontario and Maine in the north, Nebraska in the west, and south to Texas and Florida"
Platanus occidentalis, Closely related species (see Platanus) occur in Mexico and the southwestern states of the United States
Platanus occidentalis," It is sometimes grown for timber, and has become naturalized in some areas outside its native range"
Platanus occidentalis," It can be found growing successfully in Bismarck, North Dakota, and it is sold as far south as Okeechobee"
Platanus occidentalis, The American sycamore is also well adapted to life in Argentina and Australia and is quite widespread across the Australian continent especially in the cooler southern states such as Victoria and New South Wales
Platanus occidentalis,"


== Uses ==

The American sycamore is able to endure a big city environment and was formerly extensively planted as a shade tree, but due to the defacing effects of anthracnose it has been largely usurped in this function by the resistant London plane"
Platanus occidentalis,Its wood has been used extensively for butcher's blocks
Platanus occidentalis," It has been used for boxes and crates; although coarse-grained and difficult to work, it has also been used to make furniture, siding, and musical instruments"

== Pests and diseases ==
The American sycamore is a favored food plant of the pest sycamore leaf beetle"
Platanus occidentalis,"
American sycamore is susceptible to plane anthracnose disease (Apiognomonia veneta, syn"
Platanus occidentalis," Gnomonia platani), an introduced fungus found naturally on the Oriental plane P"
Platanus occidentalis," orientalis, which has evolved considerable resistance to the disease"
Platanus occidentalis," Although rarely killed or even seriously harmed, American sycamore is commonly partially defoliated by the disease, rendering it unsightly as a specimen tree"
Platanus occidentalis,"
Sometimes mistaken for frost damage, the disease manifests in early spring, wilting new leaves and causing mature leaves to turn brown along the veins"
Platanus occidentalis,"  Infected leaves typically shrivel and fall, so that by summer the tree is regrowing its foliage"
Platanus occidentalis,"  Cankers form on twigs and branches near infected leaves, serving to spread the disease by spore production and also weakening the tree"
Platanus occidentalis," Because cankers restrict the flow of nutrients, twigs and branches afflicted by cankers eventually die"
Platanus occidentalis,  Witch's broom is a symptom reflecting the cycle of twigs dying
Platanus occidentalis,"As a result of the fungus' damage, American sycamore is often avoided as a landscape tree, and the more resistant London plane (P"

Populus deltoides,"8 m (9 ft 2 in) diameter, one of the largest North American hardwood trees"
Populus deltoides," The bark is silvery-white, smooth or lightly fissured when young, becoming dark gray and deeply fissured on old trees"
Populus deltoides," 

The twigs are grayish-yellow and stout, with large triangular leaf scars"
Populus deltoides," The winter buds are slender, pointed, 1–2 cm (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) long, yellowish brown, and resinous"
Populus deltoides, It is one of the fastest growing trees in North America
Populus deltoides," In Mississippi River bottoms, height growth of 3–5 m (10–15 ft) per year for a few years has been seen"
Populus deltoides, Sustained height growth of 1
Populus deltoides,5-meter (5 ft) height growth and 2
Populus deltoides,5-centimeter (1 in) diameter growth per year for 25 years is common
Populus deltoides,"
Eastern cottonwood's range is centered in the Midwestern US"
Populus deltoides," It is not common in the Northeast and is reported only in scattered occurrences, which may constitute intentional plantings rather than natural ones"
Populus deltoides,"
The leaves are large, deltoid (triangular), 4–10 cm (1 1⁄2–4 in) long and 4–11 cm (1 1⁄2–4 1⁄4 in) broad with a truncated (flattened) base and a petiole 3–12 cm (1 1⁄4–4 3⁄4 in) long"
Populus deltoides," The leaf is very coarsely toothed, the teeth are curved and gland tipped, and the petiole is flat; they are dark green in the summer and turn yellow in the fall (but many cottonwoods in dry locations drop their leaves early from the combination of drought and leaf rust, making their fall color dull or absent)"
Populus deltoides," Due to the flat stem of the leaf, the leaf has the tendency to shake from even the slightest breeze"
Populus deltoides, This is one of the identifying characteristics
Populus deltoides,"It is dioecious, with the flowers (catkins) produced on single-sex trees in early spring"
Populus deltoides," The male (pollen) catkins are reddish-purple and 8–10 cm (3 1⁄4–4 in) long; the female catkins are green, 7–13 cm (2 3⁄4–5 in) long at pollination, maturing 15–20 cm (6–7 3⁄4 in) long with several 6-to-15-millimeter (1⁄4-to-9⁄16-inch) seed capsules(samaras) in early summer, which split open to release the numerous small seeds attached to cotton-like strands"
Populus deltoides, A single tree may release 40 million seeds a season

Prunus serotina,"A mature black cherry tree can easily be identified in a forest by its very broken, dark grey to black bark, which has the appearance of very thick, burnt cornflakes"
Prunus serotina," However, for about the first decade or so of its life, the bark is thin, smooth, and banded, resembling that of a birch"
Prunus serotina," It can also quickly be identified by its long, shiny leaves resembling those of a sourwood, and by an almond-like odor released when a young twig is scratched and held close to the nose"
Prunus serotina,"


== Ecology and cultivation ==
Prunus serotina is a pioneer species"
Prunus serotina," In the Midwest, it is seen growing mostly in old fields with other sunlight-loving species, such as black walnut, black locust, and hackberry"
Prunus serotina, Gleason and Cronquist (1991) describe P
Prunus serotina," serotina as ""[f]ormerly a forest tree, now abundant as a weed-tree of roadsides, waste land, and forest-margins"""
Prunus serotina," It is a moderately long-lived tree, with ages of up to 258 years known, though it is prone to storm damage, with branches breaking easily; any decay resulting, however, only progresses slowly"
Prunus serotina," Seed production begins around 10 years of age, but does not become heavy until 30 years and continues up to 100 years or more"
Prunus serotina," Germination rates are high, and the seeds are widely dispersed by birds and bears who eat the fruit and then excrete them"
Prunus serotina, Some seeds however may remain in the soil bank and not germinate for as long as three years
Prunus serotina, All Prunus species have hard seeds that benefit from scarification to germinate (which in nature is produced by passing through an animal's digestive tract)
Prunus serotina,"
Prunus serotina was widely introduced into Western and Central Europe as an ornamental tree in the mid 20th century, where it has become locally naturalized"

== Biochemistry ==

Like apricots and apples, the seeds of black cherries contain cyanogenic glycosides, compounds that can be converted into cyanide, such as amygdalin"
Prunus serotina," These compounds release hydrogen cyanide when the seed is ground or minced, which releases enzymes that break down the compounds"
Prunus serotina," These enzymes include amygdalin beta-glucosidase, prunasin beta-glucosidase and mandelonitrile lyase"
Prunus serotina," In contrast, although the flesh of cherries also contains these compounds, it does not contain the enzymes needed to produce cyanide, so the flesh is safe to eat"
Prunus serotina,"The foliage, particularly when wilted, also contains cyanogenic glycosides, which convert to hydrogen cyanide if eaten by animals"
Prunus serotina," Farmers are recommended to remove any trees that fall in a field containing livestock, because the wilted leaves could poison the animals"
Prunus serotina," Removal is not always practical, though, because they often grow in very large numbers on farms, taking advantage of the light brought about by mowing and grazing"
Prunus serotina," Entire fencerows can be lined with this poisonous tree, making it difficult to monitor all the branches falling into the grazing area"
Prunus serotina," Black cherry is a leading cause of livestock illness, and grazing animals' access to it should be limited"
Prunus serotina,"

=== Flowers ===

The flowers are produced in racemose clusters of two to five together at nodes on short spurs in spring at the same time as the new leaves appear; they are white to pink, with five petals in the wild type tree"
Prunus serrulata," The fruit of the prunus serrulate/Japanese Sakura, the Sakuranbo, has differences to the prunus avium/wild cherry, in that sakuranbo are smaller in size and are bitter in taste to the wild cherry; the sakuranbo is a globose black fruit-drupe 8–10mm in diameter"
Prunus serrulata,"  Owing to their bitter taste, the sakuranbo should not be eaten raw, or whole; the seed inside should be removed and the fruit-itself processed as preserves"
Prunus serrulata,"  
Because of its evolution, the fruit of the prunus serrulate/Japanese Sakura, the Sakuranbo, developed merely as a small, ovoid cherry-like fruit, but it is not more developed as a small amount of fleshy mass around the seed within; as the prunus serrulate/Japanese Sakura was bred for its flowers, the tree does not go beyond going through the initial motions of developing fruits but they will not ripen and will be incomplete, not producing more flesh surrounding the seed"
Prunus serrulata," They simply will not ripen the way regular cherries, bred for the fruit, will do"
Prunus serrulata,"


== Cultivation ==
Prunus serrulata is widely grown as a flowering ornamental tree, both in its native countries and throughout the temperate regions of the world"

Pyrus calleryana," However, since the color often develops very late in autumn, the leaves may be killed by a hard frost before full color can develop"
Pyrus calleryana,"
Callery pears are remarkably resistant to disease or fireblight though some cultivars such as 'Bradford' are particularly susceptible to storm damage and are regularly disfigured or even killed by strong winds, ice storms, heavy snow, or limb loss due to their naturally rapid growth rate"
Pyrus calleryana," The 'Bradford' in particular is also known for its sickly sweet, often unpleasant semen-like smell during its flowering stage"
Pyrus calleryana,The species is named after the Italian-French sinologue Joseph-Marie Callery (1810–1862) who sent specimens of the tree to Europe from China
Pyrus calleryana, The tree has a distinct scent often compared to chlorine or semen
Pyrus calleryana,"


== Cultivation ==

 
Numerous cultivars of Callery pear are offered commercially, including 'Aristocrat', 'Autumn Blaze', 'Bradford', 'Capital', 'Chanticleer' (also known as 'Cleveland Select'), 'New Bradford', 'Redspire', and 'Whitehouse'"

Pyrus calleryana,C
Pyrus calleryana," The New York Times also promoted the tree saying, ""Few trees possess every desired attribute, but the Bradford ornamental pear comes unusually to close to the ideal"
Pyrus calleryana,"""In much of North America these cultivars, particularly 'Bradford', are widely planted as ornamental trees"
Pyrus calleryana,"  The trees are tolerant of a variety of soil types, drainage levels, and soil acidity"
Pyrus calleryana," Their crown shape varies from ovate to elliptical, but may become asymmetric from limb loss due to excessive and unstable growth rate"
Pyrus calleryana," The initial symmetry of several cultivars leads to their attempted use in settings such as industrial parks, streets, shopping centers, and office parks"
Pyrus calleryana," Their dense clusters of white blossoms are conspicuous in early spring, though their smell is commonly compared to semen by many people"

Pyrus calleryana," In the South, Callery pears tend to be among the more reliable coloring trees"
Pyrus calleryana,"


== An invasive species ==

The Bradford pear and related cultivars of Pyrus calleryana are regarded as invasive species in many areas of eastern and mid-Western North America, outcompeting many native plants and trees"
Pyrus calleryana," In the northeastern United States, wild Callery pears sometimes form extensive, nearly pure stands in old fields, along roadsides, and in similar disturbed areas"
Pyrus calleryana,"
While various cultivars of the Callery pear are commonly planted for their ornamental value, their prolifically produced fruits are taken by birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings"
Pyrus calleryana," The various cultivars are generally themselves self-incompatible, unable to produce fertile seeds when self-pollinated, or cross-pollinated with another tree of the same cultivar"
Pyrus calleryana," However, if different cultivars of Callery pears are grown in proximity (within insect-pollination distance, about 300 ft or 100 m), they often produce fertile seeds that can sprout and establish wherever they are dispersed"
Pyrus calleryana, This technique was successfully used in the Dana Gould Gardens near Los Angeles
Pyrus calleryana," The resulting wild individuals, of various genetic backgrounds, can in turn interbreed, producing more viable seed and furthering expansion and dispersal of the wild stand of the species"
Pyrus calleryana, These plants often differ from the selected cultivars in their irregular crown shape and (sometimes) presence of thorns
Pyrus calleryana,"
Callery pear is reported as established outside cultivation in 152 counties in 25 states in the United States"
Pyrus calleryana," While these wild plants are sometimes called ""Bradford pear"" (for the 'Bradford' cultivar), they are actually wild-growing descendants of multiple genotypes of Pyrus calleryana, and hence more correctly referred to by the common (or scientific) name of the species itself"
Pyrus calleryana,"The Bradford pear in particular has become further regarded as a nuisance tree for its initially neat, dense upward growth, which made it desirable in cramped urban spaces"
Pyrus calleryana," Without corrective selective pruning at an early stage these weak crotches result in a multitude of narrow, weak forks, very susceptible to storm damage"
Pyrus calleryana," Because of this, and the resulting relatively short life span (typically less than 25 years), many groups have discouraged further planting of 'Bradford' and other similarly structurally deficient Callery pear cultivars (such other as 'Cleveland Select') in favor of increasing use of locally native ornamental tree species"

Quercus acutissima,"


== Uses ==
Sawtooth oak is widely planted in eastern North America and is naturalized in scattered locations; it is also occasionally planted in Europe but has not naturalised there"
Quercus acutissima," Most planting in North America was carried out for wildlife food provision, as the species tends to bear heavier crops of acorns than other native American oak species; however, the bitterness of the acorns makes it less suitable for this purpose, and sawtooth oak is becoming a problematic invasive species in some areas and states, such as Louisiana"
Quercus acutissima, Sawtooth oak trees also grow at a faster rate which helps it compete against native trees
Quercus acutissima," The wood has many of the characteristics of other oaks, but is very prone to crack and split and hence is relegated to such uses as fencing"

Quercus macrocarpa,"Quercus macrocarpa, the bur oak, sometimes spelled burr oak, is a species of oak in the white oak section Quercus sect"
Quercus macrocarpa," Quercus, native to North America in the eastern and central United States and eastern and central Canada"
Quercus macrocarpa, This plant is also called mossycup oak and mossycup white oak
Quercus macrocarpa,"
Quercus macrocarpa  is widespread in the Atlantic coastal plain from New Brunswick to North Carolina, west as far as Alberta, eastern Montana, Wyoming, and northeastern New Mexico"
Quercus macrocarpa," The vast majority of the populations are found in the eastern Great Plains, the Mississippi–Missouri–Ohio Valley, and the Great Lakes region"
Quercus macrocarpa,"


== Description ==
Quercus macrocarpa is a large deciduous tree growing up to 98 ft (30 m), rarely 160 ft (50 m), in height, and is one of the most massive oaks with a trunk diameter of up to 10 ft (3 m); reports of taller trees occur, but have not been verified"
Quercus macrocarpa," It is one of the slowest-growing oaks, with a growth rate of 1 ft (30 cm) per year when young"
Quercus macrocarpa," However, other sources state that a bur oak tree that is planted in the ground grows up to 3 ft (91 cm) per year"
Quercus macrocarpa, A 20-year-old tree will be about 20 ft (6 m) tall if grown in full sun
Quercus macrocarpa, Naturally occurring saplings in forests will typically be older
Quercus macrocarpa," Bur oaks commonly get to be 200 to 300 years old, and may live up to 400 years"
Quercus macrocarpa, The bark is a medium gray and somewhat rugged
Quercus macrocarpa,"The leaves are 2 3⁄4–6 in (7–15 cm) long and 2–5 in (5–13 cm) broad, variable in shape, with a lobed margin"
Quercus macrocarpa," Most often, the basal two-thirds is narrower and deeply lobed, while the apical third is wider and has shallow lobes or large teeth"
Quercus macrocarpa," The flowers are greenish-yellow catkins, produced in the spring"
Quercus macrocarpa," The acorns are very large, 1–2 in (2"
Quercus macrocarpa,"5–5 cm) long and 3⁄4–1 1⁄2 in (2–4 cm) broad, having a large cup that wraps much of the way around the nut, with large overlapping scales and often a fringe at the edge of the cup"
Quercus macrocarpa,"Bur oak is sometimes confused with overcup oak and white oak, both of which it occasionally hybridizes with"
Quercus macrocarpa,"

The acorns are the largest of any North American oak (thus the species name macrocarpa, from Ancient Greek μακρός makrós ""large"" and καρπός karpós ""fruit""), and are an important wildlife food; American black bears sometimes tear off branches to get them"
Quercus macrocarpa," However, heavy nut crops are borne only every few years"
Quercus macrocarpa," In this evolutionary strategy, known as masting, the large seed crop every few years overwhelms the ability of seed predators to eat the acorns, thus ensuring the survival of some seeds"
Quercus macrocarpa," Other wildlife, such as deer and porcupine, eat the leaves, twigs and bark"
Quercus macrocarpa, Cattle are heavy browsers in some areas
Quercus macrocarpa, The bur oak is the only known foodplant of Bucculatrix recognita caterpillars
Quercus macrocarpa,"
Bur oaks primarily grow in a temperate climate, in regions such as (Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, etc), where their tree rings are read as one year of growth"
Quercus macrocarpa, This is because the trees grow more in warm wet climates and less in cold dry climates
Quercus macrocarpa," So, when the season changes so does the amount the tree ring will grow for that year"
Quercus macrocarpa,"

The woody part of the tree that presents the rings is called xylem"
Quercus macrocarpa,"   The early, lighter part of the annual ring is called springwood or earlywood, and is formed in spring and early summer when warm and more wet weather prevails"
Quercus macrocarpa,"  Because of the pores being smaller, the second of two parts of the annual ring is darker in color and called summerwood or latewood"
Quercus macrocarpa,"  


== Ecology ==
Bur oak typically grows in the open, away from forest canopy"
Quercus macrocarpa," For this reason, it is an important tree on the eastern prairies, often found near waterways in otherwise more forested areas, where there is a break in the canopy"
Quercus macrocarpa," It is drought resistant, possibly because of its long taproot"
Quercus macrocarpa," At the end of the growing season, a one-year sapling may have a taproot 1"
Quercus macrocarpa,37 m (4 ft 6 in) deep and a lateral root spread of 76 cm (2 ft 6 in)
Quercus macrocarpa, The West Virginia state champion bur oak has a trunk diameter of almost 3 m (10 ft)
Quercus macrocarpa," 
Large bur oaks, older than 12 years, are fire-tolerant because of their thick bark"
Quercus macrocarpa," One of the bur oak's most common habitats, especially in Midwestern United States, is the oak savanna, where fires often occurred in early spring or late fall, especially in hill country"
Quercus macrocarpa," Without fires, bur oak is often succeeded by other tree and shrub species that are more shade-tolerant"
Quercus macrocarpa," Older bur oaks may survive in dense woodlands for 80 years, until they are weakened by wood-rot fungi in the lower branches killed by shade, and by 100 to 110 years, they are often snapped by wind storms"
Quercus macrocarpa,"


=== Cultivation ===
Quercus macrocarpa is cultivated by plant nurseries for use in gardens, in parks, and on urban sidewalks"
Quercus macrocarpa, Bur oak makes an outstanding ornamental tree
Quercus macrocarpa," Among the white oaks, it is one of the most tolerant of urban conditions, and is one of the fastest-growing of the group"
Quercus macrocarpa," It has been planted in many climates, ranging northwards to Anchorage, Alaska, and as far south as Mission, Texas"
Quercus macrocarpa," It withstands chinook conditions in Calgary, Alberta"
Quercus macrocarpa,"


=== Cultural ===

The name sometimes is spelled ""burr oak"", as for example in Burr Oak State Park in Ohio, the cities of Burr Oak, Iowa and Burr Oak, Kansas, the village of Burr Oak, Michigan, and in the title Burr Oaks by poet Richard Eberhart"

Quercus palustris, It has an 8–14 m (26–46 ft) spread
Quercus palustris, A 10-year-old tree grown in full sun will be about 8 m (26 ft) tall
Quercus palustris," Young trees have a straight, columnar trunk with smooth bark and a pyramidal canopy"
Quercus palustris,"
By the time the tree is 40 years old, it develops more rough bark with a loose, spreading canopy"
Quercus palustris," This canopy is considered one of the most distinctive features of the pin oak: the upper branches point upwards, the middle branches are at right angles to the trunk, and the lower branches droop downwards"
Quercus palustris,"The leaves are 5–16 cm (2–6 1⁄4 in) long and 5–12 cm (2–4 3⁄4 in) broad, lobed, with five or seven lobes"
Quercus palustris, Each lobe has five to seven bristle-tipped teeth
Quercus palustris, The sinuses are typically u-shaped and extremely deep cut
Quercus palustris," In fact, roughly the same amount of sinus area exists as actual leaf area"
Quercus palustris," The leaf is mostly hairless, except for a very characteristic tuft of pale orange-brown down on the lower surface where each lobe vein joins the central vein"
Quercus palustris," Overall autumn leaf coloration is generally bronze, though individual leaves may be red for a time, and is not considered particularly distinctive"
Quercus palustris,"  The acorns, borne in a shallow, thin cap, are hemispherical, 10–16 mm (13⁄32–5⁄8 in) long and 9–15 mm (11⁄32–19⁄32 in) broad, green maturing pale brown about 18 months after pollination"
Quercus palustris, The acorn is unpalatable because the kernel is very bitter
Quercus palustris,"A fast-growing pioneer or riparian species, pin oak is relatively short-lived, with a maximum lifespan of 120 years against many oaks which can live several centuries"
Quercus palustris," It is naturally a wetland tree, and develops a shallow, fibrous root system, unlike many oaks, which have a strong, deep taproot when young"
Quercus palustris," It is confined to acidic soils, and does not tolerate limestone or sandy Florida soil, and grows at low altitudes from sea level up to 350 m (1,148 ft)"
Quercus palustris," The Latin specific epithet palustris means ""of swamps"""
Quercus palustris,"
A characteristic shared by a few other oak species, and also some beeches and hornbeams, is the retention of leaves through the winter on juvenile trees, a natural phenomenon referred to as marcescence"
Quercus palustris," Young trees under 6 m (20 ft) are often covered with leaves year-round, though the leaves die in the fall, remaining attached to the shoots until the new leaves appear in the spring"
Quercus palustris," As with many other oak species, dead pin oak branches  stay on the tree for many years"
Quercus palustris," 


== Flowering and fruiting ==
Like all oaks, flowering and leaf-out occur in late spring when all frost danger has passed"
Quercus palustris," The flowers are monoecious catkins which, being self-incompatible, require the presence of another oak for pollination"
Quercus palustris," Any species in the red oak group can serve as a pollinator, but in pin oak's natural range, this will usually be northern red oak or scarlet oak"
Quercus palustris, Interspecies hybridization occurs freely
Quercus palustris, The acorns require two growing seasons to develop
Quercus palustris,"


== Associated forest cover ==
Pin oak is a major species in only one forest cover type, pin oak–sweetgum, which is found on bottom lands and some upland sites throughout the central portion of the pin oak range"
Quercus palustris, Pin oak and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) vary in their relative proportions in this cover type
Quercus palustris," Large areas of almost pure pin oak occur on the ""pin oak flats"" of the upland glacial till plains or in the bottom lands of the lower Ohio and central Mississippi River valleys"
Quercus palustris," Associated species in this forest type include red maple (Acer rubrum), American elm (Ulmus americana), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), willow oak (Quercus phellos), overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), Nuttall's oak (Quercus texana), swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii), and shellbark (Carya laciniosa) and shagbark (Carya ovata) hickories"
Quercus palustris,"Pin oak is an associated species in silver maple–American elm forests in the bottom lands along the Ohio, Wabash, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers"
Quercus palustris," A variant of this type, silver maple–American elm–pin oak–sweetgum, is found along major streams in southern Illinois and Indiana"
Quercus palustris,"Pin oak also occurs in black ash–American elm–red maple forests in poorly drained bottom lands in northern Ohio and Indiana along with silver maple (Acer saccharinum), swamp white oak, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), black tupelo, and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides)"
Quercus palustris,"


== Reaction to competition ==
Pin oak is classed as intolerant of shade"
Quercus palustris," It is less tolerant than elm, boxelder (Acer negundo), sweetgum, hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and ash, but is more tolerant than eastern cottonwood and black willow"
Quercus palustris, Pin oak usually grows in even-aged stands of dominant and co-dominant trees
Quercus palustris, Intermediate and suppressed trees in such stands usually die within a few years of being overtopped
Quercus palustris, Single pin oaks in mixed stands usually are dominants
Quercus palustris, Pin oak is considered a subclimax species
Quercus palustris," It persists on heavy, wet soils because it produces an abundance of acorns which, if released, grow faster on these sites than most of its competitors"
Quercus palustris,"Pin oaks are also classified as allelopathic, meaning they crowd out or otherwise successfully compete with understory vegetation to survive"
Quercus palustris,"


== Damaging agents ==
Although pin oak is very tolerant of dormant-season flooding, it is much less tolerant of growing-season flooding"
Quercus palustris, Trees may be injured or killed by intermittent growing-season flooding over several successive years
Quercus palustris," The trees can usually survive one growing season of continuous flooding, but will be killed by continuous flooding over 2 or 3 consecutive years"
Quercus palustris," Pin oak is rated as ""intermediately tolerant"" to growing-season flooding"
Quercus palustris," Also, since the bark of pin oak is relatively thin, the species is especially susceptible to damage by fire and decay associated with fire wounds"
Quercus palustris,"


== Uses ==
In its native range, pin oak is the most commonly used landscaping oak along with northern red oak due to its ease of transplant, relatively fast growth, and pollution tolerance"
Quercus palustris," However, as it is naturally adapted to moist, acidic soils, it may develop a condition known as iron chlorosis on less suitable locations, causing the tree to shed leaves during the growing season and rot from the top down"
Quercus palustris, Mature pin oaks are often too big to treat and this nutrient deficiency on alkaline soil may eventually kill them
Quercus palustris," The drooping lower branches can also be a problem, interfering with access for traffic and pedestrians"
Quercus palustris,"
It is also cultivated in parks and large gardens in the United Kingdom, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit"
Quercus palustris,"

The wood is generally marketed as red oak, but is of significantly inferior quality, being somewhat weaker, often with many small knots"
Quercus palustris, The wood is hard and heavy and is used in general construction and for firewood
Quercus palustris, The bark was used by some Native American tribes to make a drink for treatment of intestinal pain
Quercus palustris,"
The name ""pin oak"" is possibly due to the many small, slender twigs, but may also be from the historical use of the hard wood for pins in wooden building construction"
Quercus palustris,The pin oak is the only known food plant of Bucculatrix domicola caterpillars
Quercus palustris,"


== Associated species ==
Due to similarity in leaf shape, the pin oak is often confused with scarlet oak and black oak, and occasionally, red oak"
Quercus palustris," However, it can be distinguished by its distinctive dead branches on the lower trunk (""pins""), and its uniquely shaped crown"
Quercus palustris," The sinuses on pin oak leaves are also deeply cut, often covering just as much area as the leaf itself"
Quercus palustris,"

Quercus robur,"  The acorns form a valuable food resource for several small mammals and some birds, notably Eurasian jays Garrulus glandarius"
Quercus robur," Jays were overwhelmingly the primary propagators of oaks before humans began planting them commercially (and still remain the principal propagators for wild oaks), because of their habit of taking acorns from the umbra of its parent tree and burying them undamaged elsewhere"
Quercus robur," Mammals, notably squirrels who tend to hoard acorns and other nuts usually leave them too abused to grow in the action of moving or storing them"
Quercus robur,"


== Commercial forestry ==

Quercus rubra," It is a native of North America, in the eastern and central United States and southeast and south-central Canada"
Quercus rubra," It grows from the north end of the Great Lakes, east to Nova Scotia, south as far as Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana, and west to Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Minnesota"
Quercus rubra," It has been introduced to small areas in Western Europe, where it can frequently be seen cultivated in gardens and parks"
Quercus rubra, It prefers good soil that is slightly acidic
Quercus rubra," Often simply called red oak, northern red oak is so named to distinguish it from southern red oak (Q"
Quercus rubra," falcata), also known as the Spanish oak"
Quercus rubra, It is sometimes called champion oak
Quercus rubra, It is also the state tree of New Jersey and the provincial tree of Prince Edward Island
Quercus rubra,"


== Description ==
In many forests, this deciduous tree grows straight and tall, to 28 m (92 ft), exceptionally to 43 m (141 ft) tall, with a trunk of up to 50–100 cm (20–39 in) diameter"
Quercus rubra," Open-grown trees do not get as tall, but can develop a stouter trunk, up to 2 m (6"
Quercus rubra,6 ft) in diameter
Quercus rubra," It has stout branches growing at right angles to the stem, forming a narrow round-topped head"
Quercus rubra," It grows rapidly and is tolerant of many soils and varied situations, although it prefers the glacial drift and well-drained borders of streams"
Quercus rubra," In the southeastern United States, it is frequently a part of the canopy in an oak-heath forest, but generally not as important as some other oaks"
Quercus rubra,"Under optimal conditions and full sun, northern red oak is fast growing and a 10-year-old tree can be 5–6 m (16–20 ft) tall"
Quercus rubra, Trees may live up to 400 years and a living example of 326 years was noted in 2001
Quercus rubra,"Northern red oak is easy to recognize by its bark, which features ridges that appear to have shiny stripes down the center"
Quercus rubra," A few other oaks have bark with this kind of appearance in the upper tree, but the northern red oak is the only tree with the striping all the way down the trunk"
Quercus rubra,Northern red oak is the most common species of oak in the northeastern US after the closely related pin oak (Q
Quercus rubra, palustris)
Quercus rubra, The red oak group as a whole are more abundant today than they were when European settlement of North America began as forest clearing and exploitation for lumber much reduced the population of the formerly dominant white oaks
Quercus rubra,"As with most other deciduous oaks, leafout takes place in spring when day length has reached 13 hours--it is tied entirely to photoperiod and will take place regardless of air temperature"
Quercus rubra," As a consequence (see below), in cooler regions, northern red oaks often lose their flowers to late spring frosts, resulting in no seed crop for the year"
Quercus rubra, The catkins and leaves emerge at the same time
Quercus rubra," The ripe acorns are released from the tree in early October, and leaf drop begins when day length falls under 11 hours"
Quercus rubra, The timing of leafout and leaf drop can vary by as much as three weeks in the northern and southern US
Quercus rubra, Seedlings emerge in spring when soil temperatures reach 70°F (21°C)

Winter buds: Dark chestnut brown (reddish brown), ovate, acute, generally 6 mm long
Leaves: Alternate, seven to nine-lobed, oblong-ovate to oblong, five to ten inches long, four to six inches broad; seven to eleven lobes tapering gradually from broad bases, acute, and usually repandly dentate and terminating with long bristle-pointed teeth; the second pair of lobes from apex are largest; midrib and primary veins conspicuous"
Quercus rubra, Lobes are often less deeply cut than most other oaks of the red oak group
Quercus rubra," Leaves emerge from the bud convolute, pink, covered with soft silky down above, coated with thick white tomentum below"
Quercus rubra," When full grown are dark green and smooth, sometimes shining above, yellow green, smooth or hairy on the axils of the veins below"
Quercus rubra," In autumn they turn a rich red, sometimes brown"
Quercus rubra," Often the petiole and midvein are a rich red color in midsummer and early autumn, though this is not true of all red oaks"
Quercus rubra," The acorns mature in about 18 months after pollination; solitary or in pairs, sessile or stalked; nut oblong-ovoid with broad flat base, full, with acute apex, one half to one and one-fourth of an inch long, first green, maturing nut-brown; cup, saucer-shaped and shallow, 2 cm (0"

Quercus rubra," Despite this bitterness, they are eaten by deer, squirrels and birds"
Quercus rubra,"Red oak acorns, unlike the white oak group, display epigeal dormancy and will not germinate without a minimum of three months' exposure to sub-40 °F (4 °C) temperatures"
Quercus rubra, They also take two years of growing on the tree before development is completed
Quercus rubra,"


== Ecology ==

Over the last few decades, the northern red oak has dealt with several environmental factors, mainly disease, predation by insects, and limited opportunities for dispersal"
Quercus rubra, These stresses have impacted the species' ability to proliferate in both the Northeast and Europe
Quercus rubra," The various environmental responses observed in Quercus rubra across several temperate environmental conditions have allowed for it to serve as a model organism for studying symbiotic relationships, dispersal, and habituation between tree species"
Quercus rubra,"


=== Pests and diseases ===
Canker pathogen, Diplodia corticola, has become a major pathogen to the species over the last decade, causing leaf browning, bark cracking and bleeding, and high rates of tree mortality across the northeastern United States"
Quercus rubra," The northern red oak is also characterized as one of the most susceptible species to plant fungi Phytophthora cinnamomi and Phytophthora ramorum, which have caused severe, red-black cankers in the trunk region of the species"
Quercus rubra, Both P
Quercus rubra, cinnamomi and P
Quercus rubra," ramorum grow under warmer temperature conditions; as a result, northern red oak trees found in California, France, and northern Spain all have higher incidences of fungal infection"
Quercus rubra,"


=== Animals ===
In Europe, northern red oak acorns have become food of several moth species, particularly Cydia fagiglandana and Cydia splendana, which increases their niche breadths and reduces their competition with Curculio weevils"
Quercus rubra," Due to this, germination rates among the northern red oak acorns have decreased significantly and resulted in less seed dispersal by animals within Poland"
Quercus rubra," In addition, limited opportunities for dispersal have become costly for the northern red oak in Europe"
Quercus rubra," European animals known for dispersing tendencies, such as the European jay and wood mouse, have been found to be more attracted to local oak species"
Quercus rubra," Northern red oak kernels have highly concentrated amounts of tannin, a biochemical known as a predator deterrent and produce a bitter taste, which has limited appeal for consumption among animal species"
Quercus rubra,"


=== Fungi ===
Quercus rubra has effective ectomycorrhizal relationships that have been correlated with increased growth rates"
Quercus rubra, Northern red oak trees have been shown to increase growth in the presence of various ascomycetes that coil at the base of the oak trunk
Quercus rubra," The fungi, which eventually proliferate at the stumps of deciduous trees, have been found to be host-specific to both Quercus rubra and Quercus montana and primarily promote growth upon infection"
Quercus rubra,"


=== Invasiveness in Europe ===
It was introduced to Europe in the 1700s and has naturalized throughout most of western and central Europe"
Quercus rubra,"
Across western and central Europe, the northern red oak has become the fourth-most significant invasive species, colonizing several regions across Poland, Belgium, Ukraine and Lithuania"
Quercus rubra," The northern red oak is primarily found on the edges of woodland reserves in Europe, where light availability, tannin concentration, and animal dispersal are the most necessary component for the species' longevity and survival"
Quercus rubra," The high influx of the species in Europe is primarily based on its economic productivity as a fast-growing source of timber; however, it has been linked to lower percentages of trace elements and minerals found in the surrounding soil and reduced richness among native oak species such as Quercus robur"
Quercus rubra,"


== Uses ==

The northern red oak is one of the most important oaks for timber production in North America"
Quercus rubra," Quality red oak is of high value as lumber and veneer, while defective logs are used as firewood"
Quercus rubra," Other related oaks are also cut and marketed as red oak, although their wood is not always of as high a quality"
Quercus rubra," These include eastern black oak, scarlet oak, pin oak, Shumard oak, southern red oak and other species in the red oak group"
Quercus rubra," Construction uses include flooring, veneer, interior trim, and furniture"
Quercus rubra," It is also used for lumber, railroad ties, and fence posts"
Quercus rubra,"
Red oak wood grain is so open that smoke can be blown through it from end-grain to end-grain on a flat-sawn board"
Quercus rubra," For this reason, it is subject to moisture infiltration and is unsuitable for outdoor uses such as boatbuilding or exterior trim"
Quercus rubra,"


=== Ornamental use ===
Quercus rubra is grown in parks and large gardens as a specimen tree"
Quercus rubra," It is not planted as often as the closely related pin oak as it develops a taproot and quickly becomes difficult to transplant, however modern growing pots have made starting seedlings with taproots easier than in the past"
Quercus rubra,"


== Abiotic stresses ==
Northern red oak seedlings have been known to have a high mortality rate in northeast regions prone to spring freeze, particularly in Massachusetts"
Quercus rubra," Acorns produced by oaks in this region are typically smaller in size as an adaptation to frost produced in high latitudes; however, the resulting smaller seedlings have produced limited opportunities for animal consumption and dispersal"
Quercus rubra," Flooding along the continental United States has been shown to be a major issue for the northern red oak, in which decreased phloem transport and photosynthetic activity has been observed, but only after multiple days of flooding, indicating that the northern red oak has adapted moderate resistance to excess water exposure"
Quercus rubra," The northern red oak has also developed tolerance mechanisms for heat stress, particularly observed in deciduous forests in the Southeastern United States, where, during summer heat waves, temperatures can exceed 40 °C"
Quercus rubra, The leaves of the northern red oak have been observed to have an acclimation to Rubisco activase activity that is directly correlated to acclimations with repeated exposure to heat waves
Quercus rubra, Consistent photosynthetic activity in the red oak has also been observed in the presence of high carbon dioxide levels that often occur as a result of elevated temperatures
Quercus rubra,"

Quercus velutina, It is a close relative of the California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) found in western North America
Quercus velutina,"


== Description ==
In the northern part of its range, black oak is a relatively small tree, reaching a height of 20–25 m (66–82 ft) and a diameter of 90 cm (35 in), but it grows larger in the south and center of its range, where heights of up to 42 m (138 ft) are known"
Quercus velutina, Black oak is well known to readily hybridize with other members of the red oak (Quercus sect
Quercus velutina, Lobatae) group of oaks being one parent in at least a dozen different named hybrids
Quercus velutina,"

The leaves of the black oak are alternately arranged on the twig and are 10–20 cm (4–8 in) long with 5–7 bristle-tipped lobes separated by deep U-shaped notches"
Quercus velutina," The upper surface of the leaf is a shiny deep green, the lower is yellowish-brown"
Quercus velutina, There are also stellate hairs on the underside of the leaf that grow in clumps
Quercus velutina,"The inner bark of the black oak contains a yellow pigment called quercitron, which was sold commercially in Europe until the 1940s"

== Soil and topography ==
In southern New England, black oak grows on cool, moist soils"
Quercus velutina," Elsewhere it occurs on warm, moist soils"
Quercus velutina,"
The most widespread soils on which black oak grows are the Udalfs and Udolls"
Quercus velutina," These soils are derived from glacial materials, sandstones, shales, and limestone and range from heavy clays to loamy sands with some having a high content of rock or chert fragments"
Quercus velutina," Black oak grows best on well drained, silty clay to loam soils"
Quercus velutina,"
Black oak grows on all aspects and slope positions"
Quercus velutina, It grows best in coves and on middle and lower slopes with northerly and easterly aspects
Quercus velutina," It is found at elevations up to 1,200 m (3,900 ft) in the southern Appalachians"
Quercus velutina,"
The most important factors determining site quality for black oak are the thickness and texture of the A horizon, texture of the B horizon, aspect, and slope position"
Quercus velutina, Other factors may be important in localized areas
Quercus velutina," For example, in northwestern West Virginia increasing precipitation to 1,120 mm (44 in) resulted in increased site quality; more than 1,120 mm (44 in) had no further effect"
Quercus velutina," In southern Indiana, decreasing site quality was associated with increasing slope steepness"
Quercus velutina,"
Near the limits of black oak's range, topographic factors may restrict its distribution"
Quercus velutina, At the western limits black oak is often found only on north and east aspects where moisture conditions are most favorable
Quercus velutina, In southern Minnesota and Wisconsin it is usually found only on ridge tops and the lower two-thirds of south- and west-facing slopes

Quercus velutina,"), grape (Vitis spp"
Quercus velutina,"), poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia)"
Quercus velutina,"


== Flowers and fruiting ==
Black oak is monoecious"
Quercus velutina, The staminate flowers develop from leaf axils of the previous year and the catkins emerge before or at the same time as the current leaves in April or May
Quercus velutina, The pistillate flowers are borne in the axils of the current year's leaves and may be solitary or occur in two- to many-flowered spikes
Quercus velutina," The fruit, an acorn that occurs singly or in clusters of two to five, is about one-third enclosed in a scaly cup and matures in 2 years"
Quercus velutina," Black oak acorns are brown when mature and ripen from late August to late October, depending on geographic location"
Quercus velutina,"


== Seed production and dissemination ==
In forest stands, black oak begins to produce seeds at about age 20 and reaches optimum production at 40 to 75 years"
Quercus velutina, It is a consistent seed producer with good crops of acorns every 2 to 3 years
Quercus velutina," In Missouri, the average number of mature acorns per tree was generally higher than for other oaks over a 5-year period, but the number of acorns differed greatly from year to year and from tree to tree within the same stand"
Quercus velutina,"
The number of seeds that become available for regenerating black oak may be low even in good seed years"
Quercus velutina," Insects, squirrels, deer, turkey, small rodents, and birds consume many acorns"

Quercus velutina,"
Black oak acorns from a single tree are dispersed over a limited area by squirrels, mice, and gravity"
Quercus velutina, The blue jay may disperse over longer distances
Quercus velutina,"


== Response to competition ==
Black oak is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade"
Quercus velutina," It is less tolerant than many of its associates such as white and chestnut oaks, hickories, beech (Fagus grandifolia), maples, elm, and blackgum"
Quercus velutina," However, it is more tolerant than yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), black cherry, and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)"
Quercus velutina, It is about the same as northern red oak and scarlet oak
Quercus velutina, Seedlings usually die within a few years after being established under fully stocked over stories
Quercus velutina, Most black oak sprouts under mature stands develop crooked stems and flat-topped or misshapen crowns
Quercus velutina," After the over story is removed, only the large stems are capable of competing successfully"
Quercus velutina, Seedlings are soon overtopped
Quercus velutina, The few that survive usually remain in the intermediate crown class
Quercus velutina,"
Even-aged silvicultural systems satisfy the reproduction and growth requirements of black oak better than the all-aged or uneven-aged selection system"
Quercus velutina," Under the selection system, black oak is unable to reproduce because of inadequate light"
Quercus velutina, Stands containing black oak that are managed under the selection system will gradually be dominated by more shade-tolerant species
Quercus velutina,"
Dormant buds are numerous on the boles of black oak trees"
Quercus velutina," These buds may be stimulated to sprout and produce branches by mechanical pruning or by exposure to greatly increased light, as by thinning heavily or creating openings in the stand"
Quercus velutina, Dominant trees are less likely to produce epicormic branches than those in the lower crown classes
Quercus velutina,"


== Damaging agents ==
Wildfires seriously damage black oak trees by killing the cambium at the base of the trees"
Quercus velutina, This creates an entry point for decay fungi
Quercus velutina, The end result is loss of volume because of heart rot
Quercus velutina, Trees up to pole size are easily killed by fire and severe fires may even kill saw timber
Quercus velutina, Many of the killed trees sprout and form a new stand
Quercus velutina," However, the economic loss may be large unless at least some of it can be salvaged"
Quercus velutina,"
Oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) is a potentially serious vascular disease of black oak that is widespread throughout the eastern United States"
Quercus velutina, Trees die within a few weeks after the symptoms first appear
Quercus velutina," Usually scattered individuals or small groups of trees are killed, but areas several hectares in size may be affected"
Quercus velutina, The disease is spread from tree to tree through root grafts and over larger distances by sap-feeding beetles (Nitidulidae) and the small oak bark beetle
Quercus velutina,"
Shoestring root rot (Armillaria mellea) attacks black oak and may kill trees weakened by fire, lightning, drought, insects, or other diseases"
Quercus velutina," A root rot, Phytophthora cinnamomi, may kill seedlings in the nursery"
Quercus velutina, Cankers caused by Strumella and Nectria species damage the holes of black oak but seldom kill trees
Quercus velutina," Foliage diseases that attack black oak are the same as those that typically attack species in the red oak group and include anthracnose (Gnomonia quercina), leaf blister (Taphrina spp"
Quercus velutina,"), powdery mildews (Phyllactinia corylea and Microsphaera alni), oak-pine rusts (Cronartium spp"
Quercus velutina,"), and leaf spots (Actinopelte dryina)"
Quercus velutina,"
Tunneling insects that attack the boles of black oak and cause serious lumber degrade include the carpenter worm (Prionoxystus robiniae), red oak borer (Enaphalodes rufulus), the twolined chestnut borer (Agrilus bilineatus), the oak timber worm (Arrhenodes minutus), and the Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus)"
Quercus velutina,"
The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) feeds on foliage and is potentially the most destructive insect"
Quercus velutina," Although black oaks withstood a single defoliation, two or three defoliations in successive years kill many trees"
Quercus velutina," Other defoliators that attack black oak and may occasionally be epidemic are the variable oak leaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo), the orange striped oakworm (Anisota senatoria), and the brown tail moth (Euproctis chrysorrhoea)"
Quercus velutina,"
The nut weevils (Curculio spp"
Quercus velutina,"), gall-forming cynipids (Callirhytis spp"
Quercus velutina,"), filbertworm (Melissopus latiferreanus), and acorn moth (Valentinia glandulella) damage black oak acorns"

Black locust's current range has been expanded by humans distributing the tree for landscaping and now includes Pakistan, India, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Northern and South Africa, temperate regions in Asia, New Zealand, Southern South America"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,Black locust is an interesting example of how one plant species can be considered invasive even on the continent to which it is native
Robinia pseudo-acacia," For example, within the western United States, New England region, northern California, and in the Midwest, black locust is considered an invasive species"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, In the prairie and savanna regions of the Midwest black locust can dominate and shade open habitats
Robinia pseudo-acacia," These ecosystems have been decreasing in size, and black locust is contributing to this reduction; when black locust invades an area, it will convert the grassland ecosystem into a forested ecosystem where the grasses are displaced"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Black locust has been listed as invasive in Connecticut and Wisconsin, and prohibited in Massachusetts"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"In Australia black locust has become naturalized within Victoria, New South Wales, South, and Western Australia"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, It is considered an environmental weed there
Robinia pseudo-acacia," In South Africa, it is regarded as a weed because of its suckering habit"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


== Description ==
Black locust reaches a typical height of 40–100 feet (12–30 m) with a diameter of 2–4 feet (0"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,61–1
Robinia pseudo-acacia,22 m)
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Exceptionally, it may grow up to 52 metres (171 ft) tall and 1"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,6 metres (5
Robinia pseudo-acacia,2 ft) diameter in very old trees
Robinia pseudo-acacia, It is a very upright tree with a straight trunk and narrow crown that grows scraggly with age
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The dark blue-green compound leaves with a contrasting lighter underside give this tree a beautiful appearance in the wind and contribute to its grace
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Black locust is a shade-intolerant species and therefore is typical of young woodlands and disturbed areas where sunlight is plentiful and the soil is dry"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," In this sense, black locust can often grow as a weed tree"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," It also often spreads by underground shoots or suckers, which contributes to the weedy character of this species"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Young trees are often spiny, but mature trees often lack spines"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," In the early summer black locust flowers; the flowers are large and appear in large, intensely fragrant clusters reminiscent of orange blossoms"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," The leaflets fold together in wet weather and at night (nyctinasty), as some change of position at night is a habit of the entire leguminous family"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Although similar in general appearance to the honey locust, the black locust lacks that tree's characteristic long branched thorns on the trunk, having instead the pairs of short prickles at the base of each leaf; the leaflets are also much broader than honey locust"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," It may also resemble Styphnolobium japonicum, which has smaller flower spikes and lacks spines"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


=== Detailed description ===

The bark is a reddish black and gray and tinged with red or orange in the grooves"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, It is deeply furrowed into grooves and ridges which run up and down the trunk and often cross and form diamond shapes
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
The roots of black locust contain nodules that allow it to fix nitrogen, as is common within the pea family"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
The branches are typically zig-zaggy and may have ridges and grooves or may be round"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," When young, they are at first coated with white silvery down; this soon disappears, and they become pale green and afterward reddish or greenish brown"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Spines may or may not be present on young trees, root suckers, and branches near the ground; typically, branches high above the ground rarely contain spines"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, R
Robinia pseudo-acacia, pseudoacacia is quite variable in the quantity and amount of spines present as some trees are densely prickly and other trees have no prickles at all
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The spines typically remain on the tree until the young thin bark to which they are attached is replaced by the thicker mature bark
Robinia pseudo-acacia," They develop from stipules (small leaf-like structures that grow at the base of leaves), and since stipules are paired at the base of leaves, the spines will be paired at the bases of leaves"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, They range from 
Robinia pseudo-acacia,25–
Robinia pseudo-acacia,8 inches (0
Robinia pseudo-acacia,64–2
Robinia pseudo-acacia,03 cm) in length and are somewhat triangular with a flared base and sharp point
Robinia pseudo-acacia, Their color is of a dark purple and they adhere only to the bark
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Wood is pale yellowish brown, heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, and very durable in contact with the ground"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The wood has a specific gravity of 0
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"7333, and a weight of approximately 732 kg per cubic metre (45"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,7 pounds per cubic foot)
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
The leaves are compound, meaning that each leaf contains many smaller leaf like structures called leaflets, which are roughly paired on either side of the stem that runs through the leaf (rachis)"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," There is typically one leaflet at the tip of the leaf (odd pinnate), and the leaves are alternately arranged on the stem"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Each leaf is 6–14 inches (15–36 cm) long and contains 9-19 leaflets, each being 1–2 inches (2"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,5–5
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"1 cm)long, and "
Robinia pseudo-acacia,25–
Robinia pseudo-acacia,75 inches (0
Robinia pseudo-acacia,64–1
Robinia pseudo-acacia,91 cm) wide
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The leaflets are rounded or slightly indented at the tip and typically rounded at the base
Robinia pseudo-acacia," The leaves come out of the bud folded in half, yellow green, covered with silvery down which soon disappears"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Each leaflet initially has a minute stipel, which quickly falls, and is connected to the (rachis) by a short stem or petiolule"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The leaves are attached to the branch with slender hairy petioles which is grooved and swollen at the base
Robinia pseudo-acacia," The stipules are linear, downy, membranous at first and occasionally develop into prickles"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The leaves appear relatively late in spring
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
The leaf color of the fully grown leaves is a dull dark green above and paler beneath"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,  In the fall the leaves turn a clear pale yellow
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
The flowers open in May or June for 7–10 days, after the leaves have developed"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, They are arranged in loose drooping clumps (racemes) which are typically 4–8 inches (10–20 cm) long
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The flowers themselves are cream-white (rarely pink or purple) with a pale yellow blotch in the center and imperfectly papilionaceous in shape
Robinia pseudo-acacia, They are  about 1 inch (2
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"5 cm) wide, very fragrant, and produce large amounts of nectar"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Each flower is perfect, having both stamens and a pistil (male and female parts)"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," There are 10 stamens enclosed within the petals; these are fused together in a diadelphous configuration, where the filaments of 9 are all joined to form a tube and one stamen is separate and above the joined stamens"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The single ovary is superior and contains several ovules
Robinia pseudo-acacia, Below each flower is a calyx which looks like leafy tube between the flower and the stem
Robinia pseudo-acacia, It is made from fused sepals and is dark green and may be blotched with red
Robinia pseudo-acacia," The pedicels (stems which connect the flower to the branch) are slender, "
Robinia pseudo-acacia,5 inches (1
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"3 cm), dark red or reddish green"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
The fruit is a typical legume fruit, being a flat and smooth pea-like pod 2–4 inches (5"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,1–10
Robinia pseudo-acacia,2 cm) long and 
Robinia pseudo-acacia,5 inches (1
Robinia pseudo-acacia,3 cm) broad
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The fruit usually contains 4-8 seeds
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The seeds are dark orange brown with irregular markings
Robinia pseudo-acacia, They ripen late in autumn and hang on the branches until early spring
Robinia pseudo-acacia, There are typically 25500 seeds per pound
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Winter buds: Minute, naked (having no scales covering them), three or four together, protected in a depression by a scale-like covering lined on the inner surface with a thick coat of tomentum and opening in early spring"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,  When the buds are forming they are covered by the swollen base of the petiole
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Cotyledons are oval in shape and fleshy"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


== Reproduction and dispersal ==
Black locust reproduces both sexually via flowers, and asexually via root suckers"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," The flowers are pollinated by insects, primarily by Hymenopteran insects"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The physical construction of the flower separates the male and female parts so that self-pollination will not typically occur
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The seedlings grow rapidly but they have a thick seed coat which means that not all seeds will germinate
Robinia pseudo-acacia," The seed coat can be weakened via hot water, sulfuric acid, or be mechanically scarified, which will allow a greater quantity of the seeds to grow"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The seeds are produced in good crops every year or every other year
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Root suckers are an important method of local reproduction of this tree"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The roots may grow suckers after damage (by being hit with a lawn mower or otherwise damaged) or after no damage at all
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"  The suckers are stems which grow from the roots, directly into the air and may grow into full trees"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The main trunk also has the capability to grow sprouts and will do so after being cut down
Robinia pseudo-acacia, This makes removal of black locust difficult as the suckers need to be continually removed from both the trunk and roots or the tree will regrow
Robinia pseudo-acacia, This is considered an asexual form or reproduction
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
The suckers allow black locust to grow into colonies which often exclude other species"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, These colonies may form dense thickets which shade out competition
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Black locust has been found to have either 2n=20 or 2n=22 chromosomes"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


=== Human mediated dispersal ===
Black locust has been spread and used as a plant for erosion control as it is fast growing and generally a tough tree"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," The wood, considered the most durable wood in North America, has been very desirable and motivated people to move the tree to areas where it is not native so the wood can be farmed and used"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


== Ecology ==

When growing in sandy areas this plant can enrich the soil by means of its nitrogen-fixing nodules, allowing other species to move in"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, On sandy soils black locust may also often replace other vegetation which cannot fix nitrogen
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"Black locust is a typical early successional plant, a pioneer species, and it grows best in bright sunlight and does not handle shade well"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, It specializes in colonizing disturbed areas and edges of woodlots before it is eventually replaced with more shade-tolerant species
Robinia pseudo-acacia, It prefers dry to moist limestone soils but will grow on most soils as long as they are not wet or poorly drained
Robinia pseudo-acacia,  This tree tolerates a soil pH range of 4
Robinia pseudo-acacia,6 to 8
Robinia pseudo-acacia,2
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Within its native range it will often grow on soils of Inceptisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols groups"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Black locust does not do well on compacted, clayey or eroded soils"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, Black locust is a part of the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Black locust is not a particularly valuable plant for wildlife, but does provide valuable cover when planted on previously open areas"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, Its seeds are also eaten by bobwhite quail and other game birds and squirrels
Robinia pseudo-acacia, Woodpeckers may also nest in the trunk since older trees are often infected by heart rot
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


== Pests ==
Locust leaf miner Odontota dorsalis attacks the tree in spring and turns the leaves brown by mid summer, it slows the growth of the tree but not seriously"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The locust borer Megacyllene robiniae larvae carve tunnels into the trunk of the tree and make it more prone to being knocked down by the wind
Robinia pseudo-acacia,  Heart rot is the only significant disease affecting black locust
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Black locust is also attacked by Chlorogenus robiniae, a virus which causes witch's broom growths, clear leaflet veins are a symptom of the disease"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


== Uses ==


=== Cultivation ===
Black locust is a major honey plant in the eastern US, and has been planted in European countries"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," In many European countries, it is the source of the renowned acacia honey"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, Flowering starts after 140 growing degree days
Robinia pseudo-acacia," However, its blooming period is short (about 10 days) and it does not consistently produce a honey crop year after year"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Weather conditions can have quite an effect on the amount of nectar collected, as well; in Ohio for example, good locust honey flow happens in one of five years"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
It can be easily propagated from roots, softwood, or hardwood and this allows for easy reproduction of the plant"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, Cultivars may also be grafted as this ensures the parent and daughter plant will be genetically identical
Robinia pseudo-acacia,R
Robinia pseudo-acacia, pseudoacacia is considered an excellent plant for growing in highly disturbed areas as an erosion control plant
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The roots are shallow aggressive which help to hold onto soil and the tree grows quickly and on poor soils due to its ability to fix nitrogen
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Black locust has nitrogen-fixing bacteria on its root system, so it can grow on poor soils and is an early colonizer of disturbed areas"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," With fertilizer prices rising, the importance of black locust as a nitrogen-fixing species is also noteworthy"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The mass application of fertilizers in agriculture and forestry is increasingly expensive; therefore nitrogen-fixing tree and shrub species are gaining importance in managed forestry
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"It is also planted for firewood because it grows rapidly, is highly resilient in a variety of soils, and it grows back even faster from its stump after harvest by using the existing root system"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," (see coppicing)
In Europe, it is often planted along streets and in parks, especially in large cities, because it tolerates pollution well"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


==== Cultivars ====
Several cultivars exist but 'Frisia' seems to be one of the most planted ones"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"

'Decaisneana' has been considered a cultivar but is more accurately a hybrid (R"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, pseudoacacia x R
Robinia pseudo-acacia, viscosa)
Robinia pseudo-acacia, It has light rose-pink colored flowers and small or no prickles
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
‘Frisia’, a selection with bright yellow-green leaves and red prickles, is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
'Purple robe' has dark rose-pink flowers and bronze red new growth"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, The flowers tend to last longer than on the wild tree
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
'Tortuosa', a small tree with curved and distorted branches"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
'Unifoliola', a plant with fewer leaflets, no prickles, and a shorter height"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


=== Wood ===

The wood is extremely hard, being one of the hardest woods in Northern America"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," It is very resistant to rot, and durable, making it prized for furniture, flooring, paneling, fence posts, and small watercraft"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Wet, newly cut planks have an offensive odor which disappears with seasoning"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,  Black locust is still in use in some rustic handrail systems
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"  In the Netherlands and some other parts of Europe, black locust is one of the most rot-resistant local trees, and projects have started to limit the use of tropical wood by promoting this tree and creating plantations"
Robinia pseudo-acacia, Flavonoids in the heartwood allow the wood to last over 100 years in soil
Robinia pseudo-acacia," As a young man, Abraham Lincoln spent much of his time splitting rails and fence posts from black locust logs"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"

Black locust is highly valued as firewood for wood-burning stoves; it burns slowly, with little visible flame or smoke, and has a higher heat content than any other species that grows widely in the Eastern United States, comparable to the heat content of anthracite"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," For best results, it should be seasoned like any other hardwood, but black locust is also popular because of its ability to burn even when wet"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," In fireplaces, it can be less satisfactory because knots and beetle damage make the wood prone to ""spitting"" coals for distances of up to several feet"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," If the black locust is cut, split, and cured while relatively young (within 10 years), thus minimizing beetle damage, ""spitting"" problems are minimal"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"In 1900, the value of Robinia pseudoacacia was reported to be practically destroyed in nearly all parts of the United States beyond the mountain forests which are its home by locust borers which riddle the trunk and branches"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Were it not for these insects, it would be one of the most valuable timber trees that could be planted in the northern and middle states"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Young trees grow quickly and vigorously for a number of years, but soon become stunted and diseased, and rarely live long enough to attain any commercial value"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


=== Food and medicine ===
In traditional medicine of India, different parts of R"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," pseudoacacia are used as laxative, antispasmodic, and diuretic"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,In Romania the flowers are sometimes used to produce a sweet and perfumed jam
Robinia pseudo-acacia," This means manual harvesting of flowers, eliminating the seeds and boiling the petals with sugar, in certain proportions, to obtain a light sweet and delicate perfume jam"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"
Although the bark and leaves are toxic, various reports suggest that the seeds and the young pods of the black locust are edible"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Shelled seeds are safe to harvest from summer through fall, and are edible both raw and/or boiled"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"  Due to the small nature of the seeds, shelling them efficiently can prove tedious and difficult"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," In France, Italy and Romania, R"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," pseudoacacia flowers are eaten as beignets after being coated in batter and fried in oil; they are also eaten in Japan, largely as tempura"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


== Toxicity ==
The bark, leaves, and wood are toxic to both humans and livestock"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Important constituents of the plant are the toxalbumin robin, which loses its toxicity when heated, and robinin, a nontoxic glucoside"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"Horses that consume the plant show signs of anorexia, depression, incontinence, colic, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmia"
Robinia pseudo-acacia," Symptoms usually occur about 1 hour following consumption, and immediate veterinary attention is required"
Robinia pseudo-acacia,"


== Flavonoids content ==
Black locust leaves contain flavone glycosides characterised by spectroscopic and chemical methods as the 7-O-β-d-glucuronopyranosyl-(1 → 2)[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 6)]-β-d-glucopyranosides of acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone), apigenin (5,7,4′-trihydroxyflavone), diosmetin (5,7,3′-trihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone) and luteolin (5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone)"

Salix babylonica,"Salix babylonica (Babylon willow or weeping willow; Chinese: 垂柳; pinyin: chuí liǔ) is a species of willow native to dry areas of northern China, but cultivated for millennia elsewhere in Asia, being traded along the Silk Road to southwest Asia and Europe"
Salix babylonica,"


== Description ==
Salix babylonica is a medium- to large-sized deciduous tree, growing up to 20–25 m (66–82 ft) tall"
Salix babylonica," It grows rapidly, but has a short lifespan, between 40 and 75 years"
Salix babylonica," The shoots are yellowish-brown, with small buds"
Salix babylonica," The leaves are alternate and spirally arranged, narrow, light green, 4–16 cm long and 0"
Salix babylonica,"5–2 cm broad, with finely serrate margins and long acuminate tips; they turn a gold-yellow in autumn"
Salix babylonica," The flowers are arranged in catkins produced early in the spring; it is dioecious, with the male and female catkins on separate trees"
Salix babylonica,"

		
		
		


== Taxonomy ==
Salix babylonica was described and named scientifically by Carolus Linnaeus in 1736, who knew the species as the pendulous-branched (""weeping"") variant then recently introduced into the Clifford garden in Hartekamp in The Netherlands"
Salix babylonica,"


=== Horticultural selections and related hybrids ===

Early Chinese cultivar selections include the original weeping willow, Salix babylonica 'Pendula', in which the branches and twigs are strongly pendulous, which was presumably spread along ancient trade routes"
Salix babylonica,"  These distinctive trees were subsequently introduced into England from Aleppo in northern Syria in 1730, and have rapidly become naturalised, growing well along rivers and in parks"
Salix babylonica," These plants are all females, readily propagated vegetatively, and capable of hybridizing with various other kinds of willows, but not breeding true from seed"
Salix babylonica, This type of tree is grown very easily through plant propagation
Salix babylonica,"
Two cultivated hybrids between pendulous Salix babylonica and other species of  Salix willows also have pendulous branchlets, and are more commonly planted than S"
Salix babylonica," babylonica itself:

Salix × pendulina, a hybrid with S"
Salix babylonica," babylonica accepted as the female parent, but with the male parent unidentified, probably being either S"
Salix babylonica, euxina or S
Salix babylonica," × fragilis, but perhaps S"
Salix babylonica, pentandra
Salix babylonica,"  Of these possibilities, S"
Salix babylonica," × fragilis is itself a hybrid, with S"
Salix babylonica, alba and S
Salix babylonica, euxina as parental species
Salix babylonica,"
Salix × sepulcralis, is a hybrid between S"
Salix babylonica, alba and S
Salix babylonica, babylonica
Salix babylonica,Cultivars derived from either of these hybrids are generally better adapted than S
Salix babylonica, babylonica to the more humid climates of most heavily populated regions of Europe and North America
Salix babylonica,"


=== Relation to Salix matsudana ===
A similar willow species also native to northern China, Salix matsudana (Chinese willow), is now included in Salix babylonica as a synonym by many botanists, including the Russian willow expert Alexey Skvortsov"
Salix babylonica, The only reported difference between the two species is S
Salix babylonica," matsudana has two nectaries in each female flower, whereas S"
Salix babylonica," babylonica has only one; however, this character is variable in many willows (for example, crack willow, Salix fragilis, can have either one or two), so even this difference may not be taxonomically significant"
Salix babylonica,"


== Cultivation ==

S"
Salix babylonica," babylonica, especially its pendulous-branched (""weeping"") form, has been introduced into many other areas, including Europe and the southeastern United States, but beyond China, it has not generally been as successfully cultivated as some of its hybrid derivatives, being sensitive to late-spring frosts"
Salix babylonica,"  In the more humid climates of much of Europe and eastern North America, it is susceptible to a canker disease, willow anthracnose (Marssonina salicicola), which makes infected trees very short-lived and unsightly"
Salix babylonica,"


=== Cultivars ===
Salix babylonica (Babylon willow) has many cultivars, including:

'Babylon' (synonym: 'Napoleon') is the most widely grown cultivar of S"
Salix babylonica," babylonica, with its typical weeping branches"
Salix babylonica,"
'Crispa' (synonym: 'Annularis') is a mutant of 'Babylon', with spirally curled leaves"
Salix babylonica,"Various cultivars of Salix matsudana (Chinese willow) are now often included within Salix babylonica, treated more broadly, including:

'Pendula' is one of the best weeping trees, with a silvery shine, hardier, and more disease resistant"
Salix babylonica,"
'Tortuosa' is an upright tree with twisted and contorted branches"
Salix babylonica,"Yet other weeping willow cultivars are derived from interspecific Salix hybrids, including S"
Salix babylonica, babylonica in their parentage
Salix babylonica,"  The most widely grown weeping willow cultivar is Salix × sepulcralis 'Chrysocoma', with bright yellowish branchlets"
Salix babylonica,"


== Uses ==
Peking willow is a popular ornamental tree in northern China, and is also grown for wood production and shelterbelts there, being particularly important around the oases of the Gobi Desert, protecting agricultural land from desert winds"
Salix babylonica,"


== Origin:  China, not Babylon ==
The epithet babylonica in this Chinese species' scientific name (S"
Salix babylonica," babylonica), as well as the related common names ""Babylon willow"" or ""Babylon weeping willow"", derive from a misunderstanding by Linnaeus that this willow was the tree described in the Bible in the opening of Psalm 137 (here in Latin and English translations):

From the Clementine Vulgate (Latin, 1592):Super flumina Babylonis illic sedimus et flevimus, cum recordaremur Sion"
Salix babylonica,"
In salicibus in medio ejus suspendimus organa nostra"
Salix babylonica,
Salix babylonica,
Salix babylonica,
Salix babylonica,"Here, ""salicibus"" is the dative plural of the Latin noun salix, the willows, used by Linnaeus as the name for the willow genus Salix"
Salix babylonica,"

From the King James Version (English, 1611):By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion"
Salix babylonica,"
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof"
Salix babylonica,"From the Revised Standard Version (English, 1952):By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion
On the willows there we hung up our lyres"
Salix babylonica,
Salix babylonica,
Salix babylonica,
Salix babylonica,"Despite these Biblical references to ""willows"", whether in Latin or English, the trees growing in Babylon along the Euphrates River in ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and named gharab in early Hebrew, are not willows (Salix) in either the modern or the classical sense, but the Euphrates poplar (Populus euphratica), with willow-like leaves on long, drooping shoots, in the related genus Populus"
Salix babylonica,"  Both Populus and Salix are in the plant family Salicaceae, the willow family"
Salix babylonica,"
These Babylonian trees are correctly called poplars, not willows, in the New International Version of the Bible (English, 1978):

By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion
There on the poplars we hung our harps"

Taxodium distichum," Although it grows best in warm climates, the natural northern limit of the species is not due to a lack of cold tolerance, but to specific reproductive requirements: further north, regeneration is prevented by ice damage to seedlings"
Taxodium distichum, Larger trees are able to tolerate much lower temperatures and lower humidity
Taxodium distichum,"
In 2012 scuba divers discovered an underwater cypress forest several miles off the coast of Mobile, Alabama, in 60 feet of water"
Taxodium distichum," The forest contains trees that could not be dated with radiocarbon methods, indicating that they are more than 50,000 years old and thus most likely lived in the early glacial interval of the last ice age"
Taxodium distichum," The cypress forest is well preserved, and when samples are cut they still smell like fresh cypress"
Taxodium distichum," A team, which has not yet published its results in a peer-reviewed journal, is studying the site"
Taxodium distichum," One possibility is that hurricane Katrina exposed the grove of bald cypress, which had been protected under ocean floor sediments"
Taxodium distichum,"


== Reproduction and early growth ==

The bald cypress is monoecious"
Taxodium distichum, Male and female strobili mature in one growing season from buds formed the previous year
Taxodium distichum, The male catkins are about 2 mm (0
Taxodium distichum,"079 in) in diameter and are borne in slender, purplish, drooping clusters 7 to 13 cm (2 3⁄4 to 5 in) long that are conspicuous during the winter on this deciduous conifer"
Taxodium distichum, Pollen is shed in March and April
Taxodium distichum, Female conelets are found singly or in clusters of two or three
Taxodium distichum, The globose cones turn from green to brownish-purple as they mature from October to December
Taxodium distichum, The cones are 13 to 36 mm (0
Taxodium distichum,51 to 1
Taxodium distichum,42 in) in diameter and consist of 9 to 15 four-sided scales that break away irregularly after maturity
Taxodium distichum," Each scale can bear two (rarely three) irregular, triangular seeds with thick, horny, warty coats and projecting flanges"
Taxodium distichum, The number of seeds per cone averages 16 and ranges from 2 to 34
Taxodium distichum," Cleaned seeds number from about 5,600 to 18,430 per kg (2,540 to 8,360 per lb)"
Taxodium distichum,"


=== Seed production and dissemination ===
Some seeds are produced every year, and good seed crops occur at three- to five-year intervals"
Taxodium distichum," At maturity, the cone scales with their resin-coated seeds adhering to them, or sometimes entire cones, drop to the water or ground"
Taxodium distichum," This drop of mature seeds is often hastened by squirrels, which eat bald cypress seeds, but usually drop several scales with undamaged seeds still attached to each cone they pick"
Taxodium distichum, Floodwaters spread the scales or cones along streams and are the most important means of seed dissemination
Taxodium distichum,"


=== Seedling development ===
Germination is epigeal"
Taxodium distichum," Under swamp conditions, germination generally takes place on a sphagnum moss or a wet-muck seedbed"
Taxodium distichum," Seeds will not germinate under water, but some will remain viable for 30 months under water"
Taxodium distichum," By contrast, seeds usually fail to germinate on better drained soils because of the lack of surface water"
Taxodium distichum," Thus, a soil saturated but not flooded for a period of one to three months after seedfall is required for germination"
Taxodium distichum,"

After germination, seedlings must grow fast enough to keep at least part of their crowns above floodwaters for most of the growing season"
Taxodium distichum," Bald cypress seedlings can endure partial shading, but require overhead light for good growth"
Taxodium distichum, Seedlings in swamps often reach heights of 20 to 75 cm (8 to 29
Taxodium distichum,5 in) their first year
Taxodium distichum," Growth is checked when a seedling is completely submerged by flooding, and prolonged submergence kills the seedling"
Taxodium distichum,"In nurseries, Taxodium seeds show an apparent internal dormancy that can be overcome by various treatments, usually including cold stratification or submerging in water for 60 days"
Taxodium distichum, Nursery beds are sown in spring with pretreated seeds or in fall with untreated seeds
Taxodium distichum, Seedlings usually reach 75 to 100 cm (29
Taxodium distichum,5 to 39
Taxodium distichum,5 in) in height during their first (and usually only) year in the nursery
Taxodium distichum, Average size of 1-0 nursery-grown seedlings in a seed source test including 72 families was 81
Taxodium distichum,4 cm (32
Taxodium distichum,0 in) tall and 1
Taxodium distichum,1 cm (0
Taxodium distichum,43 in) in diameter
Taxodium distichum,Control of competing vegetation may be necessary for a year or more for bald cypress planted outside of swamps
Taxodium distichum," Five years after planting on a harrowed and bedded, poorly drained site in Florida, survival was high, but heights had increased only 30 cm (12 in), probably because of heavy herbaceous competition"
Taxodium distichum," Seedlings grown in a crawfish pond in Louisiana, where weed control and soil moisture were excellent through June, averaged 2"
Taxodium distichum,9 m (9
Taxodium distichum,5 ft) and 3
Taxodium distichum,5 cm (1
Taxodium distichum,4 in) diameter at breast heigh after five years
Taxodium distichum," However, a replicate of the same sources planted in an old soybean field, where weed control and soil moisture were poor, resulted in the same diameter, but a smaller average seedling height of 2"
Taxodium distichum,1 m (6
Taxodium distichum,9 ft)
Taxodium distichum," When planted in a residential yard and weeded and watered, they averaged 3"
Taxodium distichum,7 m (12 ft) tall three years later
Taxodium distichum,"


=== Vegetative reproduction ===
Bald cypress is one of the few conifer species that sprouts"
Taxodium distichum," Thrifty sprouts are generally produced from stumps of young trees, but trees up to 60 years old also send up healthy sprouts if the trees are cut during the fall or winter"
Taxodium distichum," However, survival of these sprouts is often poor, and those that live are usually poorly shaped and do not make quality sawtimber trees"
Taxodium distichum," Stumps of trees up to 200 years old may also sprout, but the sprouts are not as vigorous and are more subject to wind damage as the stump decays"
Taxodium distichum," In the only report on the rooting of bald cypress cuttings found in the literature, cuttings from trees five years old rooted better than those from older trees"
Taxodium distichum,"


== Ecology ==

The seeds remain viable for less than one year, and are dispersed in two ways"
Taxodium distichum, One is by water: the seeds float and move on water until flooding recedes or the cone is deposited on shore
Taxodium distichum," The second is by wildlife: squirrels eat seeds, but often drop some scales from the cones they harvest"
Taxodium distichum," Seeds do not germinate under water and rarely germinate on well-drained soils; seedlings normally become established on continuously saturated, but not flooded, soils for one to three months"
Taxodium distichum," After germination, seedlings must grow quickly to escape floodwaters; they often reach a height of 20–75 cm (up to 100 cm in fertilized nursery conditions) in their first year"
Taxodium distichum, Seedlings die if inundated for more than about two to four weeks
Taxodium distichum, Natural regeneration is therefore prevented on sites that are always flooded during the growing season
Taxodium distichum," Although vigorous saplings and stump sprouts can produce viable seed, most specimens do not produce seed until they are about 30 years old"
Taxodium distichum," In good conditions, bald cypress grows fairly fast when young, then more slowly with age"
Taxodium distichum," Trees have been measured to reach 3 m in five years, 21 m in 41 years, and 36 m in height in 96 years; height growth has largely ceased by the time the trees are 200 years old"
Taxodium distichum," Some individuals can live over 1,000 years"
Taxodium distichum, Determination of the age of an old tree may be difficult because of frequent missing or false rings of stemwood caused by variable and stressful growing environments
Taxodium distichum,"

Bald cypress trees growing in swamps have a peculiarity of growth called cypress knees"
Taxodium distichum, These are woody projections from the root system project above the ground or water
Taxodium distichum," Their function was once thought to be to provide oxygen to the roots, which grow in the low dissolved oxygen waters typical of a swamp (as in mangroves)"
Taxodium distichum," However, evidence for this is scant; in fact, roots of swamp-dwelling specimens whose knees are removed do not decrease in oxygen content and the trees continue to thrive"
Taxodium distichum, Another more likely function is structural support and stabilization
Taxodium distichum," Bald cypress trees growing on flood-prone sites tend to form buttressed bases, but trees grown on drier sites may lack this feature"
Taxodium distichum," Buttressed bases and a strong, intertwined root system allow them to resist very strong winds; even hurricanes rarely overturn them"
Taxodium distichum,Many agents damage T
Taxodium distichum, distichum trees
Taxodium distichum," The main damaging (in some cases lethal) agent is the fungus Lauriliella taxodii, which causes a brown pocket rot known as ""pecky cypress"
Taxodium distichum,""" It attacks the heartwood of living trees, usually from the crown down to the roots"
Taxodium distichum," A few other fungi attack the sapwood and the heartwood of the tree, but they do not usually cause serious damage"
Taxodium distichum," Insects such as the cypress flea beetle (Systena marginalis) and the bald cypress leafroller (Archips goyerana) can seriously damage trees by destroying leaves, cones or bark"
Taxodium distichum," Nutrias also clip and unroot young bald cypress seedlings, sometimes killing a whole plantation in a short amount of time"
Taxodium distichum,"


== Conservation ==
In 2002, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources identified T"
Taxodium distichum, distichum as a state protected plant with the status of Threatened
Taxodium distichum," Globally, the species is listed as of Least Concern by the IUCN"
Taxodium distichum,"


== Cultivation and uses ==

The bald cypress is hardy and can be planted in hardiness zones 4 through 10 in the US"
Taxodium distichum," The species is a popular ornamental tree that is cultivated for its light, feathery foliage and orangey brown to dull red autumnal color"
Taxodium distichum," In cultivation it thrives on a wide range of soils, including well-drained sites where it would not grow naturally because juvenile seedlings cannot compete with other vegetation"
Taxodium distichum," Cultivation is successful far north of its native range, even to southern Canada"
Taxodium distichum," It is also commonly planted in Europe, Asia, and other temperate and subtropical locales"
Taxodium distichum," It does, however, require hot summers for good growth"
Taxodium distichum," When planted in locales with the cool summers of oceanic climates, growth is healthy but very slow; some specimens in northeastern England have only grown to 4–5 m tall in 50 years and do not produce cones"
Taxodium distichum," One of the oldest specimens in Europe was planted in the 1900s in the Arboretum de Pézanin in Burgundy, France"
Taxodium distichum,"
Bald cypress has great merchantable yields"
Taxodium distichum," In virgin stands, yields from 112–196 m³/ha were common, and some stands may have exceeded 1,000 m³/ha"
Taxodium distichum," The lumber is valuable for building construction, fence posts, planking in boats, river pilings, doors, blinds, flooring, shingles, garden boxes, caskets, interior trim and cabinetry"
Taxodium distichum,"  The odorless wood, which closely resembles that of other Cupressus species, has long been valued for its resistance to water"
Taxodium distichum," Still usable prehistoric wood is often found in swamps as far north as New Jersey, and occasionally as far north as Connecticut, although it is more common in the southeastern states"
Taxodium distichum," This partially mineralized wood is harvested from swamps in the southeastern states, and is greatly prized for special uses such as for carvings"
Taxodium distichum," The fungus Lauriliella taxodii causes a specific form of the wood called ""pecky cypress"", which is used for decorative wall paneling"
Taxodium distichum,"
The bald cypress was designated the official state tree of Louisiana in 1963"
Taxodium distichum, Some consider it to be a symbol of the southern swamps of the United States
Taxodium distichum,"
The bald cypress was used by Native Americans to create coffins, homes, drums and canoes"
Taxodium distichum, Joshua D
Taxodium distichum," Brown, the first settler of Kerrville, Texas, made his living producing shingles from bald cypress trees that grew along the Guadalupe River of the Texas Hill Country"
Taxodium distichum," Beginning in the early 1990s, the bald cypress was harvested heavily to make paneling, mulch and shingles"

Tilia americana," Propagated plants grow rapidly in a rich soil, but are susceptible to many pests"
Tilia americana,"
The American basswood is known for being one of the most difficult native North American trees to propagate from seed, as they not only have a low viability rate (approximately 30% of all seeds are viable), but quickly develop an extremely hard seed coating that may delay germination for up to two years"
Tilia americana," If planting them, it is recommended to gather the seeds in early autumn and sow them before they dry out and form a coating"
Tilia americana, This will then allow germination to occur immediately
Tilia americana," Overall, seeds are not a major part of the tree's reproductive strategy and it instead mostly spreads by self-coppicing"
Tilia americana," All juvenile basswoods coppice extremely readily, and even old trees will often sprout from the stump if cut"

== Hemlock woolly adelgid ==

The species is currently threatened by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), a sap-sucking bug accidentally introduced from East Asia to the United States in 1924, and first found in the native range of eastern hemlock in the late 1960s"
Tsuga canadensis," The adelgid has spread very rapidly in southern parts of the range once becoming established, while its expansion northward is much slower"
Tsuga canadensis," Virtually all the hemlocks in the southern Appalachian Mountains have seen infestations of the insect within the last five to seven years, with thousands of hectares of stands dying within the last two to three years"
Tsuga canadensis, Attempts to save representative examples on both public and private lands are on-going
Tsuga canadensis," A project named ""Tsuga Search"", funded by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, is being conducted to save the largest and tallest remaining eastern hemlocks in the Park"
Tsuga canadensis," Through Tsuga Search, hemlocks have been found with trunk volumes up to 44"

Tsuga canadensis," From its foundation in the early Holocene (around 16,000 BP) in what is now the southeastern US, T"
Tsuga canadensis, canadensis expanded rapidly and successfully into its potential range
Tsuga canadensis,"  However, palynological analyses show the hemlock population experienced a pronounced decline approximately 5,500 BP that lasted for about 1,000 years"
Tsuga canadensis," Continued research points to other, though less dramatic, dips in Holocene hemlock populations"
Tsuga canadensis," Pathogens, insects, and climatic change, and a combination of these, have all been proposed to explain these anomalies"
Tsuga canadensis," The eastern hemlock increased again after the major decline, but did not recover its former place as a dominant species"
Tsuga canadensis,"


== Exceptional trees ==
Due to its being a long-lived tree, several very large or otherwise impressive trees exist along the east coast of North America"
Tsuga canadensis," One organization, the Eastern Native Tree Society (ENTS), has been particularly active in discovering and measuring these trees"
Tsuga canadensis," In the southern Appalachians, many individuals reach 45 metres (148 ft) tall, and one tree has been measured in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to 52"

Tsuga canadensis," The center of maximum size development for the species is the southern Appalachians, especially the Great Smoky Mountains"
Tsuga canadensis,"


== Cultivation ==
Tsuga canadensis has long been a popular tree in cultivation"
Tsuga canadensis, The tree's preference for partial shade and tolerance of full shade allows it to be planted in areas where other conifers would not easily grow
Tsuga canadensis," In addition, its very fine-textured foliage that droops to the ground, its pyramidal growth habit, and its ability to withstand hard pruning make it a desirable ornamental tree"
Tsuga canadensis," In cultivation, it prefers sites that are slightly acidic to neutral with nutrient-rich and moist but well-drained soil"
Tsuga canadensis," It is most often used as a specimen, for a screen, or in small group plantings, though it can also be trained as a dense formal hedge"
Tsuga canadensis," It should not be used on roadsides where salt is used in winter, as its foliage is sensitive to salt spray"
Tsuga canadensis," It is also poorly adapted as a windbreak tree, as wind exposure causes dieback in winter"
Tsuga canadensis," It has several drawbacks, such as a fairly low tolerance of urban stress, intolerance for very wet or very dry soils, and susceptibility to attack by the hemlock woolly adelgid, though this is treatable"
Tsuga canadensis, Its tendency to shed needles rapidly after being cut down renders it unsuitable as a Christmas tree
Tsuga canadensis,"
It was introduced to British gardens in 1736"
Tsuga canadensis," In the UK, it is encountered frequently in gardens both large and small, as well as some parks, and is most common in the eastern areas of the country"
Tsuga canadensis," It is sometimes employed as a hedge, but is considered inferior for this usage compared to Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock); it is not well adapted to the UK climate and as a consequence often has a poorly developed, forked and sinuous trunk there"
Tsuga canadensis," In Germany, it is the most frequently seen hemlock in cultivation, and is also used in forestry"
Tsuga canadensis,"

Ulmus americana," Moreover, several triploid trees known only in cultivation, such as 'Jefferson', are possessed of a high degree of resistance to DED, which ravaged American elms in the 20th century"
Ulmus americana," This suggests that the diploid parent trees, which have markedly smaller cells than the tetraploid, may too be highly resistant to the disease"
Ulmus americana,"


== Classification ==
Ulmus americana was first described and named by Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum, published in 1753"
Ulmus americana, No subspecies or varieties are currently recognized within the species
Ulmus americana,"


== Description ==
The American elm is a deciduous hermaphroditic tree which, before the introduction of DED, commonly grew to more than 100 feet (30 m) tall with a trunk whose diameter at breast height was more than 4 feet (1"
Ulmus americana,"2 m) and whose circumference was more than 150 inches (380 cm) when supporting a high, spreading umbrella-like canopy"
Ulmus americana," The leaves are alternate, 7–20 cm long, with double-serrate margins and an oblique base"
Ulmus americana," The perfect flowers are small, purple-brown and, being wind-pollinated, apetalous"
Ulmus americana," The flowers are also protogynous, the female parts maturing before the male, thus reducing, but not eliminating, self-fertilization, and emerge in early spring before the leaves"
Ulmus americana, The fruit is a flat samara 2 cm long by 1
Ulmus americana,"5 cm broad, with a circular papery wing surrounding the single 4–5 mm seed"
Ulmus americana," As in the closely related European White Elm Ulmus laevis, the flowers and seeds are borne on 1–3 cm long stems"
Ulmus americana," American Elm is wholly insensitive to daylight length (photoperiod), and will continue to grow well into autumn until injured by frost"
Ulmus americana," Ploidy is 2n = 56, or more rarely, 2n = 28"
Ulmus americana,"

		
		
		
		


== Ecology ==
The American elm occurs naturally in an assortment of habitats, most notably rich bottomlands, floodplains, stream banks, and swampy ground, although it also often thrives on hillsides, uplands and other well-drained soils"
Ulmus americana," On more elevated terrain, as in the Appalachian Mountains, it is most often found along rivers"
Ulmus americana,  The species' wind-dispersed seeds enable it to spread rapidly as suitable areas of habitat become available
Ulmus americana, American elm produces its seed crop in late spring (which can be as early as February and as late as June depending on the climate) and the seeds usually germinate right away with no cold stratification needed (occasionally some might remain dormant until the following year)
Ulmus americana," The species attains its greatest growth potential in the Northeastern US, while elms in the Deep South and Texas grow much smaller and have shorter lifespans, although conversely their survival rate in the latter regions is higher due to the climate being unfavorable for the spread of DED"
Ulmus americana,"
In the United States, the American elm is a major member of four major forest cover types: black ash-American elm-red maple; silver maple-American elm; sugarberry-American elm-green ash; and sycamore-sweetgum-American elm, with the first two of these types also occurring in Canada"
Ulmus americana," A sugar maple-ironwood-American elm cover type occurs on some hilltops near Témiscaming, Quebec"
Ulmus americana,The leaves of the American elm serve as food for the larvae of a number of species of Lepidoptera (see List of Lepidoptera that feed on elms)
Ulmus americana,"  These include such butterflies as the Eastern Comma (Polygonia comma), Question Mark
(Polygonia interrogationis), Mourning Cloak (Nymphalis antiopa), Painted Lady
(Vanessa cardui) and Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax), as well as such moths as the Columbian Silkmoth (Hyalophora columbia) and the Banded Tussock Moth (Pale Tiger Moth) (Halysidota tessellaris)"
Ulmus americana,"


== Pests and diseases ==
The American elm is highly susceptible to DED and elm yellows"
Ulmus americana," In North America, there are three species of elm bark beetles: one native, Hylurgopinus rufipes (""native elm bark beetle""); and two invasive, Scolytus multistriatus (""smaller European elm bark beetle"") and Scolytus schevyrewi (""banded elm bark beetle"")"
Ulmus americana," Although intensive feeding by elm bark beetles can kill weakened trees, their main impact is as vectors of DED"
Ulmus americana,"
American elm is also moderately preferred for feeding and reproduction by the adult elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola and highly preferred for feeding by the Japanese beetle Popillia japonica in the United States"
Ulmus americana,"
U"
Ulmus americana," americana is also the most susceptible of all the elms to verticillium wilt, whose external symptoms closely mimic those of DED"
Ulmus americana," However, the condition is far less serious, and afflicted trees should recover the following year"
Ulmus americana,"


=== Dutch elm disease ===

Dutch elm disease (DED) is a fungal disease that has ravaged the American elm, causing catastrophic die-offs in cities across the range"
Ulmus americana," It has been estimated that only approximately 1 in 100,000 American elm trees is DED-tolerant, most known survivors simply having escaped exposure to the disease"
Ulmus americana," However, in some areas still not infested by DED, the American elm continues to thrive, notably in Florida, Alberta and British Columbia"
Ulmus americana, There is a notable grove of old-growth American elm trees in Manhattan's Central Park
Ulmus americana, The trees there were apparently spared because of the grove's isolation in such an intensely urban setting
Ulmus americana,"The American elm is particularly susceptible to disease because the period of infection often coincides with the period, approximately 30 days, of rapid terminal growth when new springwood vessels are fully functional"
Ulmus americana, Spores introduced outside of this period remain largely static within the xylem and are thus relatively ineffective
Ulmus americana,"The American elm's biology in some ways has helped to spare it from obliteration by DED, in contrast to what happened to the American chestnut with the chestnut blight"
Ulmus americana," The elm's seeds are largely wind-dispersed, and the tree grows quickly and begins bearing seeds at a young age"
Ulmus americana," It grows well along roads or railroad tracks, and in abandoned lots and other disturbed areas, where it is highly tolerant of most stress factors"
Ulmus americana," Elms have been able to survive and to reproduce in areas where the disease had eliminated old trees, although most of these young elms eventually succumb to the disease at a relatively young age"
Ulmus americana," There is some reason to hope that these elms will preserve the genetic diversity of the original population, and that they eventually will hybridize with DED-resistant varieties that have been developed or that occur naturally"
Ulmus americana," After 20 years of research, American scientists first developed DED-resistant strains of elms in the late 1990s"
Ulmus americana,"Elms in forest and other natural areas have been less affected by DED than trees in urban environments due to lower environmental stress from pollution and soil compaction and due to occurring in smaller, more isolated populations"
Ulmus americana,"
Fungicidal injections can be administered to valuable American elms, to prevent infection"
Ulmus americana," Such injections generally are effective as a preventive measure for up to three years when performed before any symptoms have appeared, but may be ineffective once the disease is evident"
Ulmus americana,"


== Cultivation ==
In the 19th and early 20th century, American elm was a common street and park tree owing to its tolerance of urban conditions, rapid growth, and graceful form"
Ulmus americana," This however led to extreme overplanting of the species, especially to form living archways over streets, which ultimately produced an unhealthy monoculture of elms that had no resistance to disease and pests"
Ulmus americana," Elms do not naturally form pure stands and trees used in landscaping were grown from a handful of cultivars, causing extremely low genetic diversity"
Ulmus americana," These trees' rapid growth and longevity, leading to great size within decades, also favored its horticultural use before the advent of DED"
Ulmus americana, Ohio botanist William B
Ulmus americana," Werthner, discussing the contrast between open-grown and forest-grown American elms, noted that:

In the open, with an abundance of air and light, the main trunk divides into several leading branches which leave the trunk at a sharp angle and continue to grow upward, gradually diverging, dividing and subdividing into long, flexible branchlets whose ends, at last, float lightly in the air, giving the tree a round, somewhat flattened top of beautifully regular proportions and characteristically fine twiggery"
Ulmus americana,"
It is this distinctive growth form that is so valued in the open-grown American elms of street plantings, lawns, and parks; along most narrower streets, elms planted on opposite sides arch and blend together into a leafy canopy over the pavement"
Ulmus americana," However, elms can assume many different sizes and forms depending on the location and climate zone"
Ulmus americana, The classic vase-shaped elm was mainly the result of selective breeding of a few cultivars and is much less likely to occur in naturally grown trees

Ulmus americana, American Elms are only rarely found in New Zealand
Ulmus americana,"


=== Cultivars ===

Numerous cultivars have been raised, originally for their aesthetic merit but more recently for their resistance to Dutch elm disease The total number of named cultivars is circa 45, at least 18 of which have probably been lost to cultivation as a consequence of DED or other factors:

 
The National Elm Trial, begun in 2005, is currently evaluating 19 hybrid and species cultivars in scientific plantings across the United States to better assess their strengths and weaknesses"
Ulmus americana,"The few disease-resistant selections made available to the public to date include 'Valley Forge', 'New Harmony', 'Princeton', 'Jefferson', and a set of six different clones collectively known as 'American Liberty'"
Ulmus americana," The United States National Arboretum released 'Valley Forge' and 'New Harmony' in late 1995, after screening tests performed in 1992–1993 showed both had unusually high levels of resistance to DED"
Ulmus americana, 'Valley Forge' performed especially well in these tests
Ulmus americana," 'Princeton' has been in occasional cultivation since the 1920s, and gained renewed attention after its performance in the same screening tests showed it also to have a high degree of disease resistance"
Ulmus americana," A later test performed in 2002–2003 confirmed the disease resistance of these same three varieties, and that of 'Jefferson'"
Ulmus americana, 'Jefferson' was released to wholesale nurseries in 2004 and is becoming increasingly available for planting
Ulmus americana," Thus far, plantings of these four varieties generally appear to be successful"
Ulmus americana," However, longer-term studies of 'Princeton' in Europe and the United States have suggested that the cultivar's resistance to DED may be limited (see Pests and diseases of 'Princeton')"
Ulmus americana,"
In 2005, approximately 90 'Princeton' elms were planted along Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House in Washington, D"
Ulmus americana,C
Ulmus americana," The trees, whose maintenance the National Park Service (NPS) manages, remain healthy and are thriving"
Ulmus americana," In 2007, the 'Elm Recovery Project' from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, reported that cuttings from healthy surviving old elms surveyed across Ontario had been grown to produce a bank of resistant trees, isolated for selective breeding of highly resistant cultivars"
Ulmus americana,"In 1993, Mariam B"
Ulmus americana, Sticklen and James L
Ulmus americana, Sherald reported the results of NPS-funded experiments conducted at Michigan State University in East Lansing that were designed to apply genetic engineering techniques to the development of DED-resistant strains of American elm trees
Ulmus americana," In 2007, AE Newhouse and F Schrodt of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse reported that young transgenic American elm trees had shown reduced DED symptoms and normal mycorrhizal colonization"
Ulmus americana," By 2013, researchers in both New York State and North Carolina were conducting field trials of genetically engineered DED-resistant American elms"
Ulmus americana,"


=== Hybrids and hybrid cultivars ===
Ulmus 'Rebella' (U"
Ulmus americana, americana × U
Ulmus americana, parvifolia)Thousands of attempts to cross the American elm with the Siberian elm U
Ulmus americana, pumila failed
Ulmus americana," Attempts at the Arnold Arboretum using ten other American, European and Asiatic species also ended in failure, attributed to the differences in ploidy and operational dichogamy, although the ploidy factor has been discounted by other authorities"
Ulmus americana,Success was finally achieved with the autumn-flowering Chinese elm Ulmus parvifolia by the late Prof
Ulmus americana, Eugene Smalley towards the end of his career at the University of Wisconsin–Madison after he overcame the problem of keeping Chinese elm pollen alive until spring
Ulmus americana," Only one of the hybrid clones was commercially released, as 'Rebella' in 2011 by the German nursery Eisele GmbH; the clone is not available in the United States"
Ulmus americana,"
Other artificial hybridizations with American elm are rare, and now regarded with suspicion"
Ulmus americana," Two such alleged successes by the nursery trade were 'Hamburg', and 'Kansas Hybrid', both with Siberian elm Ulmus pumila"
Ulmus americana," However, given the repeated failure with the two species by research institutions, it is now believed that the ""American elm"" in question was more likely to have been the red elm, Ulmus rubra"
Ulmus americana,"


== Other uses ==


=== Wood ===

The American elm's wood is coarse, hard, and tough, with interlacing, contorted fibers that make it difficult to split or chop, and cause it to warp after sawing"
Ulmus americana,"  Accordingly, the wood originally had few uses, save for making hubs for wagon wheels"
Ulmus americana,"  Later, with the advent of mechanical sawing, American elm wood was used for barrel staves, trunk-slats, and hoop-poles, and subsequently became fundamental to the manufacture of wooden automobile bodies, with the intricate fibers holding screws unusually well"
Ulmus americana,"


=== Pioneer and traditional uses ===
Young twigs and branchlets of the American elm have tough, fibrous bark that has been used as a tying and binding material, even for rope swings for children, and also for making whips"
Ulmus americana,"


== Notable trees ==

A number of mostly small to medium-sized American elms survive nowadays in woodlands, suburban areas, and occasionally cities, where most often the survivors had been relatively isolated from other elms and thus spared a severe exposure to the fungus"

Ulmus americana," 
The city of Cambridge had plans for it to be ""carefully cut up and a piece sent to each state of the country and to the District of Columbia and Alaska,"" according to The Harvard Crimson"
Ulmus americana," As late as the early 1930s, garden shops advertised that they had cuttings of the tree for sale, although the accuracy of the claims has been doubted"
Ulmus americana," A Harvard ""professor of plant anatomy"" examined the tree rings days after the tree was felled and pronounced it between 204 and 210 years old, making it at most 62 years old when Washington took command of the troops at Cambridge"
Ulmus americana, The tree would have been a little more than two feet in diameter (at 30 inches above ground) in 1773
Ulmus americana,"In 1896, an alumnus of the University of Washington, obtained a rooted cutting of the Cambridge tree and sent it to Professor Edmund Meany at the university"

U"
Ulmus glabra, g
Ulmus glabra, subsp
Ulmus glabra," montana (Stokes) Lindqvist in the north of the species' range (northern Britain, Scandinavia), the leaves are narrower, trees commonly with a long single trunk and a tall, narrow crown"
Ulmus glabra," However, similar structures and leaves are found on wych elms in Italy, much further to the south"
Ulmus glabra,"Much overlap is seen between populations with these characters, and the distinction may owe to environmental influence, rather than genetic variation; the subspecies are not accepted by Flora Europaea"
Ulmus glabra,"


== Description ==
The type sometimes reaches heights of 40 m, typically with a broad crown where open-grown, supported by a short bole < 2 m"
Ulmus glabra, diameter at breast height (DBH)
Ulmus glabra," Normally, root suckers are not seen; natural reproduction is by seed alone"
Ulmus glabra,"  The tree is notable for its very tough, supple young shoots, which are always without the corky ridges or 'wings' characteristic of many elms"
Ulmus glabra," The alternate leaves are deciduous, 6–17 cm long by 3–12 cm broad, usually obovate with an asymmetric base, the lobe often completely covering the short (<5 mm) petiole; the upper surface is rough"
Ulmus glabra, Leaves on juvenile or shade-grown shoots sometimes have three or more lobes near the apex
Ulmus glabra," The perfect hermaphrodite flowers appear before the leaves in early spring, produced in clusters of 10–20; they are 4 mm across on 10 mm long stems, and being wind-pollinated, are apetalous"

== Pests and diseases ==
While the species is highly susceptible to Dutch elm disease, it is less favoured as a host by the elm bark beetles, which act as vectors"
Ulmus glabra," Research in Spain has indicated the presence of a triterpene, alnulin, rendering the tree bark less attractive to the beetle than the field elm, though at 87 μg/g dried bark, its concentration is not as effective as in Ulmus laevis (200 μg/g)"
Ulmus glabra," Moreover, once the tree is dying, its bark is quickly colonized by the fungus Phoma, which radically reduces the amount of bark available for the beetle to breed on"
Ulmus glabra," In European trials, clones of apparently resistant trees were inoculated with the pathogen, causing 85 – 100% wilting, resulting in 68% mortality by the following year"
Ulmus glabra," DNA analysis by Cemagref (now Irstea) in France has determined the genetic diversity within the species is very limited, making the chances of a resistant tree evolving rather remote"
Ulmus glabra,"The Swedish Forest Tree Breeding Association at Källstorp produced triploid and tetraploid forms of the tree, but these proved no more resistant to Dutch elm disease than the normal diploid form"
Ulmus glabra,"In trials conducted in Italy, the tree was found to have a slight to moderate susceptibility to elm yellows, and a high susceptibility to the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola [6]"
Ulmus glabra,"


== Cultivation ==
The wych elm is moderately shade-tolerant, but requires deep, rich soils as typically found along river valleys"
Ulmus glabra," However, the species is intolerant of flooding, as it is of prolonged drought"
Ulmus glabra," Although rarely used as a street tree owing to its shape, it can be surprisingly tolerant of urban air pollution, constricted growing conditions, and severe pollarding"
Ulmus glabra,"
As wych elm does not sucker from the roots, and any seedlings are often consumed by uncontrolled deer populations, regeneration is very restricted, limited to sprouts from the stumps of young trees"
Ulmus glabra," The resultant decline has been extreme, and the wych elm is now uncommon over much of its former range"
Ulmus glabra," It is best propagated from seed or by layering stooled stock plants, although softwood cuttings taken in early June will root fairly reliably under mist"
Ulmus glabra,"Wych elm was widely planted in Edinburgh in the 19th century as a park and avenue tree, and despite losses, it remains abundant there, regenerating through seedlings"
Ulmus glabra," It was introduced to New England in the 18th century, and to Australia in 1860"
Ulmus glabra, It was planted in the 19th century as U
Ulmus glabra," montana at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada"

== Uses ==


=== Lumber ===
Wych elm wood is prized by craftsmen for its colouring, its crazy grain, its 'partridge-breast' or 'catspaw' markings, and when worked, its occasional iridescent greenish sheen or 'bloom'"
Ulmus glabra, The bosses on old trees produce the characteristic fissures and markings of 'burr elm' wood
Ulmus glabra," Bosses fringed with shoots are burrs, whereas unfringed bosses are burls"
Ulmus glabra," 

		
		
		


=== Medicine ===

In 18th century France, the inner bark of Ulmus glabra, orme pyramidale, had a brief reputation as a panacea;
""it was taken as a powder, as an extract, as an elixir, even in baths"
Ulmus glabra," It was good for the nerves, the chest, the stomach — what can I say? — it was a true panacea"
Ulmus glabra,""" It was this so-called ""pyramidal elm bark"" about which Michel-Philippe Bouvart famously quipped ""Take it, Madame"

Ulmus parvifolia,"


== Description ==
A small to medium deciduous, semi-deciduous (rarely semi-evergreen) tree growing to 10–18 m (33–59 ft) tall and 15–20 m (49–66 ft) wide with a slender trunk and crown"
Ulmus parvifolia," The leathery, lustrous green single-toothed leaves are small, 2–5 cm long by 1–3 cm broad, and often retained as late as December or even January in Europe and North America"
Ulmus parvifolia," The apetalous wind-pollinated perfect flowers are produced in early autumn, small and inconspicuous"
Ulmus parvifolia," The fruit is a samara, elliptic to ovate-elliptic, 10–13 mm long by 6–8 mm broad"
Ulmus parvifolia," The samara is mostly glabrous, the seed at the centre or toward the apex, borne on a stalk 1–3 mm in length; it matures rapidly and disperses by late autumn"

Many nurserymen and foresters mistakenly refer to Ulmus pumila, the rapidly growing, disease-ridden, relatively short-lived, weak-wooded Siberian elm, as ""Chinese elm"
Ulmus parvifolia,""" This has given the true Chinese elm an undeserved bad reputation"
Ulmus parvifolia, The two elms are very distinct and different species
Ulmus parvifolia," Among other obvious differences, with age the Siberian elm's bark becomes deeply ridged and furrowed, and possesses a very rough, greyish-black appearance, while the Chinese elm's smooth bark becomes flaky and blotchy, exposing very distinctive, light-coloured mottling, hence the synonym lacebark elm for the real Chinese elm"
Ulmus parvifolia,"


== Wood and timber ==
Elms, hickory and ash all have remarkably hard, tough wood that has made them popular for things like tool handles, bows and baseball bats"
Ulmus parvifolia, Chinese elm is considered the hardest of the elms
Ulmus parvifolia," Owing to its superior hardness, toughness and resistance to splitting, Chinese elm is said to be the best of all woods for chisel handles and similar uses"
Ulmus parvifolia," Chinese elm lumber is used most for furniture, cabinets, veneer and hardwood flooring, as well as specialty uses such as long bow construction and tool handles"
Ulmus parvifolia, Most of the commercially milled lumber goes directly to manufacturers rather than to retail lumber outlets
Ulmus parvifolia,"Chinese elm heartwood ranges in tone from reddish brown to light tan or flesh coloured, while the sapwood approaches off-white"
Ulmus parvifolia, The grain is often handsome and dramatic
Ulmus parvifolia,"  Unlike other elms, freshly cut Chinese elm has a peppery or spicy odour"
Ulmus parvifolia,"  While it turns easily and will take a nice polish off the lathe without any finish, and it holds detail well, the fibrous wood is usually considered too tough for carving or hand tools"
Ulmus parvifolia,"  Chinese elm contains silica which is hard on planer knives and chainsaws, but it sands fairly easily"
Ulmus parvifolia," Like other woods with interlocking grain, planes should be kept extra sharp to prevent tearing at the grain margins"
Ulmus parvifolia," It steam-bends easily, holds screws well but pilot holes and countersinking are needed"
Ulmus parvifolia,"  It tends to be a ""lively"" wood, tending to warp and distort while drying"

Ulmus procera,"The field elm  (Ulmus minor) cultivar 'Atinia' , commonly known as the English elm, formerly common elm and horse may,  and more lately the Atinian elm was, before the spread of Dutch elm disease, the most common field elm in central southern England, though not native there, and one of the largest and fastest-growing deciduous trees in Europe"
Ulmus procera, R
Ulmus procera, H
Ulmus procera," Richens noted that elm populations exist in north-west Spain and northern Portugal, and on the Mediterranean coast of France that ""closely resemble the English elm"" and appear to be ""trees of long standing"" in those regions rather than recent introductions"
Ulmus procera," Augustine Henry had earlier noted that the supposed English elms planted extensively in the Royal Park at Aranjuez from the late 16th century onwards, specimens said to have been introduced from England by Philip II and ""differing in no respects from the English elm in England"", behaved as native trees in Spain"
Ulmus procera," He suggested that the tree ""may be a true native of Spain, indigenous in the alluvial plains of the great rivers, now almost completely deforested"""
Ulmus procera,"Richens believed that English elm was a particular clone of the variable species Ulmus minor, referring to it as Ulmus minor var"
Ulmus procera, vulgaris
Ulmus procera," A 2004 survey of genetic diversity in Spain, Italy, and the UK confirmed that English elms are indeed genetically identical, clones of a single tree, said to be Columella's 'Atinian elm', once widely used for training vines, and assumed to have been brought to the British Isles by Romans for that purpose"
Ulmus procera," Thus, despite its name, the origin of the tree is widely believed to be Atina, Lazio, in Italy, the home town of Columella, whence he imported it to his vineyards in Cadiz, although the clone is no longer found in Atina and has not yet been identified further east"
Ulmus procera,"Max Coleman of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh writes: ""The advent of DNA fingerprinting has shed considerable light on the question"
Ulmus procera," A number of studies have now shown that the distinctive forms that Melville elevated to species and Richens lumped together as field elm are single clones, all genetically identical, that have been propagated by vegetative means such as cuttings or root suckers, as the flowers are completely sterile"
Ulmus procera, This means that enigmatic British elms such as 
Ulmus procera,

== Description ==
The tree often exceeded 40 m (about 130 ft) in height with a trunk less than 2 m (6"
Ulmus procera,5 ft) in diameter at breast height (dbh)
Ulmus procera," The largest specimen ever recorded in England, at Forthampton Court, near Tewkesbury, was 46 m (151 ft) tall"
Ulmus procera," While the upper branches form a fan-shaped crown, heavy, more horizontal boughs low on the bole often give the tree a distinctive 'figure-of-eight' silhouette"
Ulmus procera," The small, reddish-purple hermaphrodite apetalous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves"
Ulmus procera, The samara is nearly orbicular
Ulmus procera," The leaves are dark green, almost orbicular, < 10 cm long, without the pronounced acuminate tip at the apex typical of the genus"
Ulmus procera," They flush a lighter green in April, about a month earlier than most field elms"
Ulmus procera," Since the tree does not produce long shoots in the canopy, it does not develop the markedly pendulous habit of some field elms"
Ulmus procera," The bark of old trees is scaly, unlike the vertically-furrowed bark of ancient  trees"
Ulmus procera," The bark of English elm suckers, like that of Dutch elm suckers and of some field elm, can be corky, but Dutch elm suckers may be distinguished from English by their straighter, stouter twigs, bolder 'herringbone' pattern, and later flushing"
Ulmus procera,"
The tree is both female- and male-sterile, natural regeneration being entirely by root suckers"
Ulmus procera, Seed production in England was often unknown in any case
Ulmus procera," By the late 19th century, urban specimens in Britain were often grafted on to wych elm rootstock to eliminate suckering; Henry noted that this method of propagation seldom produced good specimens"
Ulmus procera,"

		
		
		
		
		


== Pests and diseases ==
Owing to its homogeneity, the tree has proven particularly susceptible to Dutch elm disease, but immature trees remain a common feature in the English countryside courtesy of the ability to sucker from roots"
Ulmus procera," After about 20 years, these suckers, too, become infected by the fungus and killed back to ground level"
Ulmus procera," English elm was the first elm to be genetically engineered to resist disease, at the University of Abertay Dundee"
Ulmus procera," It was an ideal subject for such an experiment, as its sterility meant no danger exists for its introgression into the countryside"
Ulmus procera,"
In the United States, English elm was found to be one of the most preferred elms for feeding by the Japanese beetle Popillia japonica"
Ulmus procera,The leaves of the English elm in the UK are mined by Stigmella ulmivora
Ulmus procera,"


== Uses ==

The English elm was once valued for many purposes, notably as water pipes from hollowed trunks, owing to its resistance to rot in saturated conditions"
Ulmus procera," It is also very resilient to crushing damage, and these two properties led to its widespread use in the construction of jetties, timber piers, lock gates, etc"
Ulmus procera," It was used to a degree in furniture manufacture, but not to the same extent as oak, because of its greater tendency to shrink, swell, and split, which also rendered it unsuitable as the major timber component in shipbuilding and building construction"
Ulmus procera, The wood has a density around 560 kg/m3
Ulmus procera,"However, English elm is chiefly remembered today for its aesthetic contribution to the English countryside"
Ulmus procera," In 1913, Henry Elwes wrote, ""Its true value as a landscape tree may be best estimated by looking down from an eminence in almost any part of the valley of the Thames, or of the Severn below Worcester, during the latter half of November, when the bright golden colour of the lines of elms in the hedgerows is one of the most striking scenes that England can produce"""
Ulmus procera,"


== Cultivation ==
The introduction of the Atinian elm to Spain from Italy is recorded by the Roman agronomist Columella"
Ulmus procera," It has also been identified by Heybroek as the elm grown in the vineyards of the Valais, or Wallis, canton of Switzerland"
Ulmus procera," Although no record has been found of its introduction to Britain from Spain,  the tree has been long believed to have arrived with the Romans, a hypothesis supported by the discovery of pollen in an excavated Roman vineyard"
Ulmus procera, The tree likely was used also as a source of leaf hay
Ulmus procera," Elms said to be English Elm, and reputedly brought to Spain from England by Philip II, were planted extensively in the Royal Park at Aranjuez and the Retiro Park, Madrid, from the late 16th century onwards"
Ulmus procera,"More than a thousand years after the departure of the Romans from Britain, English elms found far greater popularity, as the preferred tree for planting in the new hawthorn hedgerows appearing as a consequence of the Enclosure movement, which lasted from 1550 to 1850"
Ulmus procera," In parts of the Severn Valley, the tree occurred at densities over 1000 per km2, so prolific as to have been known as the 'Worcester weed'"
Ulmus procera," In the eastern counties of England, however, hedgerows were usually planted with local field elm, or with suckering hybrids"
Ulmus procera," When elm became the tree of fashion in the 18th and 19th centuries, avenues and groves of English elm were often planted, among them the elm groves in The Backs, Cambridge"
Ulmus procera," Perhaps the most famous English Elm avenue was the double row in the Long Walk, Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, planted in the 1680s on the advice of John Evelyn, and described by Elwes as ""one of the finest and most imposing avenues in the world"""
Ulmus procera, The elms were felled in 1943
Ulmus procera,"English elm was introduced into Ireland, and as a consequence of Empire has been cultivated in eastern North America and widely in south-eastern Australia and New Zealand"
Ulmus procera," It is still commonly found in Australia and New Zealand, where it is regarded at its best as a street or avenue tree"
Ulmus procera," It was also planted as a street tree on the American West Coast, notably in St Helena, California, and it has been planted in South Africa"

Ulmus procera, One large tree survives in Leicester in Cossington Street Recreation Ground
Ulmus procera," Several survive in Edinburgh (2015): one in Rosebank Cemetery (girth 3 m), one in Founders Avenue, Fettes College, and one in Inverleith Park (east avenue), while a majestic open-grown specimen (3 m) in Claremont Park, Leith Links, retains the dense, fan-vaulted crown iconic in this cultivar"
Ulmus procera," An isolated mature English elm is in the cemetery at Dervaig, Isle of Mull, Scotland"
Ulmus procera,"
Some of the most significant remaining stands are to be found overseas, notably in Australia, where they line the streets of Melbourne, protected by geography and quarantine from disease"
Ulmus procera," An avenue of 87 English Elms, planted around 1880, lines the entrance to the winery of All Saints Estate, Rutherglen, Victoria; a double avenue of 400 English Elms, planted in 1897 and 1910–15, lines Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne"
Ulmus procera," Large free-standing English Elms in Tumut, New South Wales, and Traralgon, Victoria, show the 'un-English' growth-form of the tree in tropical latitudes"

=== Brighton and the cordon sanitaire ===
Although the English elm population in Britain was almost entirely destroyed by Dutch elm disease, mature trees can still be found along the south coast Dutch Elm Disease Management Area in East Sussex"
Ulmus procera," This cordon sanitaire, aided by the prevailing southwesterly onshore winds and the topographical niche formed by the South Downs, has saved many mature elms"
Ulmus procera," Amongst these are possibly the world's oldest surviving English elms, known as the 'Preston Twins' in Preston Park, both with trunks exceeding 600 cm in circumference (2"
Ulmus procera,"0 m dbh), though the larger tree lost two limbs in August 2017 following high winds"
Ulmus procera,"

		
		


== Cultivars ==
A small number of putative cultivars have been raised since the 18th and early 19th centuries, three of which are now almost certainly lost to cultivation:
'Acutifolia', 'Atinia Pyramidalis', 'Atinia Variegata', 'Folia Aurea', 'Picturata'"
Ulmus procera,"
Though usually listed as an English Elm cultivar, Ulmus 'Louis van Houtte' ""cannot with any certainty be referred to as Ulmus procera [ = 'Atinia'] "" (W"
Ulmus procera, J
Ulmus procera, Bean)

== Hybrids, hybrid cultivars, and mutations ==
Crossability experiments conducted at the Arnold Arboretum in the 1970s apparently succeeded in hybridizing English elm with U"
Ulmus procera, glabra and U
Ulmus procera," rubra, both also protogynous species"
Ulmus procera," However, the same experiments also shewed English elm to be self-compatible, which in the light of its proven female-sterility, must cast doubt on the identity of the specimens used"
Ulmus procera," A similar doubt must hang over Henry's observation that the 'English elms' at Aranjuez (see Cultivation above) ""produced every year fertile seed in great abundance"", seed said to have been taken ""all over Europe"", presumably in the hope that it would grow into trees like the royal elms of Spain"
Ulmus procera," Given that English elm is female-sterile, the Aranjuez elms either were not after all English elm, or by the time Henry collected seed from them, English elms there had been replaced by intermediates or by other kinds"
Ulmus procera," At higher altitudes in Spain, Henry noted, such as in Madrid and Toledo, the 'English elm' did not set fertile seed"
Ulmus procera,"The 2004 study, which examined ""eight individuals classified as English elm"" collected in Lazio, Spain, and Britain, noted ""slight differences among the Amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting profiles of these eight samples, attributable to somatic mutations"""
Ulmus procera," Since 'Atinia', though female infertile, is an efficient producer of pollen and should be capable of acting as a pollen parent; it is compatible with the 2004 findings that in addition to a core population of genetically virtually identical trees deriving from a single clone,  intermediate forms of U"
Ulmus procera," minor exist, of which that clone was the pollen parent"
Ulmus procera," These might be popularly or even botanically regarded as 'English elm', though they would be genetically distinct from it, and in these, the female infertility could have gone"
Ulmus procera," The ""smooth-leaved form"" of English elm mentioned by Richens (1983), and the ""northern form"" mentioned by Oliver Rackham (1986) as having been introduced to Massachusetts, are possible examples of 'Atinia' mutations or intermediates"
Ulmus procera,"

Acer negundo,Acer negundo is a species of maple native to North America
Acer negundo," Box elder, boxelder maple, ash-leaved maple, and maple ash are among its common names in the United States; in Canada it is commonly known as Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple; in the British Isles it is known as box elder or ashleaf maple"
Acer negundo,"Box elder is a fast-growing, short-lived tree with opposite, compound leaves"
Acer negundo, It is sometimes considered a weedy or invasive species
Acer negundo," It has been introduced to and naturalized on most other continents, including in South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, much of Europe, and parts of Asia"
Acer negundo,"


== Common names ==
Indicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, A"
Acer negundo, negundo has numerous common names
Acer negundo," The names ""box elder"" and ""boxelder maple"" are based upon the similarity of its whitish wood to that of boxwood and the similarity of its pinnately compound leaves to those of some species of elder"
Acer negundo," This is the only North American maple with compound leaves, though several Asian species also have them"
Acer negundo,"Other common names are based upon this maple's similarity to ash, its preferred environment, its sugary sap, a description of its leaves, its binomial name, and so on"

Acer negundo,"


== Description ==
Acer negundo is a usually fast-growing and fairly short-lived tree that grows up to 10–25 m (35–80 ft) tall, with a trunk diameter of 30–50 cm (12–20 in)}, rarely up to 1 m (3"
Acer negundo,3 ft)} diameter
Acer negundo, It often has several trunks and can form impenetrable thickets
Acer negundo,The typical lifespan of box elder is only 60 years
Acer negundo," Under exceptionally favorable conditions, it may live to 100 years"
Acer negundo,"
The shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet waxy coating when young"
Acer negundo," Branches are smooth, somewhat brittle, and tend to retain a fresh green color rather than forming a bark of dead, protective tissue"
Acer negundo," The bark on its trunks is pale gray or light brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, and scaly"
Acer negundo,"Unlike most other maples (which usually have simple, palmately lobed leaves), Acer negundo has pinnately compound leaves that usually have three to seven leaflets"
Acer negundo," Simple leaves are also occasionally present; technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves"
Acer negundo," Although some other maples (such as Acer griseum, Acer mandshuricum and the closely related A"
Acer negundo," cissifolium) have trifoliate leaves, only A"
Acer negundo, negundo regularly displays more than three leaflets

== Taxonomy ==


=== Subspecies ===
Acer negundo is often discussed as comprising three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species"
Acer negundo," These are:

Acer negundo subsp"
Acer negundo, negundo is the main subspecies and the type to which characteristics described in the article most universally apply
Acer negundo, Its natural range is from the Atlantic Coast to the Rocky Mountains
Acer negundo,"
Acer negundo subsp"
Acer negundo, interius has more leaf serration than the main species and a more matte leaf surface
Acer negundo," As the name interus indicates, its natural range of Saskatchewan to New Mexico is sandwiched between that of the other two subspecies"
Acer negundo,"
Acer negundo subsp"
Acer negundo, californicum has larger leaves than the main species
Acer negundo, Leaves also have a velvety texture which is essential to distinguish it from A
Acer negundo, negundo subsp
Acer negundo, negundo
Acer negundo, It is found in parts of California and Arizona
Acer negundo,Some authors further subdivide A
Acer negundo, negundo subsp
Acer negundo, negundo into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct taxa is disputed by many
Acer negundo, Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient speciation
Acer negundo,"
A few botanists treat boxelder maple as its own distinct genus (Negundo aceroides) but this is not widely accepted"
Acer negundo,"


== Distribution and habitat ==

As noted, varieties thrive across the United States and Canada"
Acer negundo, It may also be found as far south as Guatemala
Acer negundo," Although native to North America, it is considered a weedy species in some areas where it is native, such as in the Northeastern United States"
Acer negundo,"In 1928, Joseph Illick, chief forester for the state of Pennsylvania, wrote in Pennsylvania Trees that box elder was ""rare and localized"" in the state"
Acer negundo," After World War II, box elder's rapid growth made it a popular landscaping tree in suburban housing developments despite its poor form, vulnerability to storm damage, and tendency to attract large numbers of box elder beetles"
Acer negundo, Intentional cultivation has thus made the tree far more abundant than it once was
Acer negundo,"
It can quickly colonize both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere"
Acer negundo," In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly in places and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe (Germany, Czech Republic, and Slovenia, middle Danube, Vistula river valley in Poland) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas and riparian biomes on calcareous soils"
Acer negundo, It has also become naturalized in eastern China and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the Australian continent where it is listed as a pest invasive species
Acer negundo,"
This species prefers bright sunlight"
Acer negundo," It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as riparian habitats"
Acer negundo," Human influence has greatly favored this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots"
Acer negundo,"


== Ecology ==
Several birds and some squirrels feed on the seeds"
Acer negundo, The evening grosbeak uses them extensively
Acer negundo,"
The boxelder bug (Boisea trivittata) lays its eggs on all maples, but prefers this species, clustering the eggs in bark crevices"
Acer negundo," The rosy maple moth (Dryocampa rubicunda) also lays its eggs on the leaves of maple trees, including the boxelder maple, so when the larvae hatch, they feed on the leaves, which in very dense populations can cause defoliation"
Acer negundo,"Small galls are formed on the leaves by a bladder mite, Aceria negundi"
Acer negundo," A gall midge, Contarinia negundinis joins and enlarges the galls of Aceria negundi"
Acer negundo," The midge sometimes creates a separate, tubular gall on the midrib or veins of the undersides of the leaves"
Acer negundo,"The cottony maple leaf scale, Pulvinaria acericola, occurs on the foliage of Acer negundo"
Acer negundo," A leaf spot fungus, Septoria negundinis creates black-ringed lesions on the leaves"
Acer negundo,"


== Cultivation ==
Although its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, A"
Acer negundo," negundo is one of the most common maples in cultivation and many interesting cultivars have been developed, including:
'Auratum' – yellowish leaves with smooth undersides
'Aureomarginatum' – creamy yellow leaf margins
'Baron' – Hardier & seedless variety
'Elegans' – distinctively convex leaves
'Flamingo' – pink and white variegation (very popular)
'Pendulum' – with weeping branches"
Acer negundo,"
'Variegatum' – creamy white leaf margins
'Violaceum' – younger shoots and branches have bluish colorThe cultivar ‘Winter Lightning’ and the variety A"
Acer negundo, negundo var
Acer negundo, violaceum have gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit
Acer negundo,"


== Uses ==

Although its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most uses, this tree has been considered as a commercial source of wood fiber, for use in fiberboard"
Acer negundo,"
There is some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens)"
Acer negundo," Primarily burl wood and injured wood, where the primary reason is this wood's reaction to injury, where the injured wood develops a red stain"
Acer negundo,"


=== Use by Native Americans ===
The Navajo use the wood to make tubes for bellows"
Acer negundo," The Cheyenne burn the wood as incense for making spiritual medicines, and during Sun Dance ceremonies"
Acer negundo, They also mix the boiled sap with shavings from the inner sides of animal hides and eat them as candy
Acer negundo,"The Meskwaki use a decoction of the inner bark as an emetic, and the Ojibwa use an infusion of the inner bark for the same purpose"
Acer negundo," The Chiricahua and Mescalero Apache dry scrapings of the inner bark and keep it as winter food, and they also boil the inner bark until sugar crystallizes out of it"
Acer negundo," The Dakota also use the sap to make sugar, as do the Omaha, the Pawnee, the Ponca, the Winnebago, and the indigenous people of Montana, who also freeze the sap and use it as a syrup"
Acer negundo, The Ojibwa mix the sap with that of the sugar maple and drink it as a beverage
Acer negundo,The Cheyenne also use the wood to make bowls and to cook meat
Acer negundo, The Keres make the twigs into prayer sticks
Acer negundo," The native peoples of Montana also use large trunk burls or knots to make bowls, dishes, drums, and pipe stems"
Acer negundo,"The Dakota people and the Omaha people make the wood into charcoal, which is used in ceremonial painting and tattooing"
Acer negundo,"The Kiowa burn the wood from the negundo subspecies in the altar fire during the peyote ceremony, and the Sioux boil the sap of this variety in the spring to make sugar"
Acer negundo,"The interius subspecies is used by Cree to make sugar from the sap, and the Tewa use the twigs as pipe stems"
Acer negundo,"


=== Archaeological artifacts ===
Acer negundo was identified in 1959 as the material used in the oldest extant wood flutes from the Americas"
Acer negundo," These early artifacts, excavated by Earl H"
Acer negundo," Morris in 1931 in the Prayer Rock district of present-day Northeastern Arizona, have been dated to 620–670 CE"
Acer negundo," The style of these flutes, now known as Anasazi flutes, uses an open tube and a splitting edge at one end"
Acer negundo," This design pre-dates the earliest extant Native American flute (which use a two-chambered design) by approximately 1,200 years"
Acer negundo,"


== Medical impact ==


=== Toxicology ===
A protoxin present in the seeds of Acer negundo, the hypoglycin A, has been identified as a major risk factor for, and possibly the cause of, a disease in horses, seasonal pasture myopathy"
Acer negundo," SPM is an equine neurological disease which occurs seasonally in certain areas of North America and Europe, with symptoms including stiffness, difficulty walking or standing, dark urine and eventually breathing rapidly and becoming recumbent"
Acer negundo," Ingestion of sufficient quantities of box elder seeds or other parts of the plant results in breakdown of respiratory, postural, and cardiac muscles"
Acer negundo, The cause of SPM was unknown for centuries despite the disease being well known among affected areas and was only positively determined in the 21st century
Acer negundo," It is analogous to Jamaican vomiting sickness in humans, with both diseases sharing the same causative toxin"
Acer negundo," Ingesting Acer negundo seeds, or other parts of the plant, may therefore be toxic to humans, in large doses"
Acer negundo,"


=== Allergenicity ===
Acer negundo is a severe allergen"
Acer negundo," Its pollination occurs from winter to spring, depending on latitude and elevation"
Acer negundo,"

Betula alleghaniensis,"91 m) in diameter, making it the largest North American species of birch"
Betula alleghaniensis," Yellow birch is long-lived, typically 150 years and some old growth forest specimens may last for 300 years"
Betula alleghaniensis,It mostly reproduces by seed
Betula alleghaniensis, Mature trees typically start producing seeds at about 40 years but may start as young as 20
Betula alleghaniensis, The optimum age for seed production is about 70 years
Betula alleghaniensis," Good seed crops are not produced every year, and tend to be produced in intervals of 1–4 years with the years between good years having little seed production"
Betula alleghaniensis," The seeds germinate best on mossy logs, decaying wood or cracks in boulders since they cannot penetrate the leaf litter layer"
Betula alleghaniensis," This can lead to odd situations such as yellow birches with their roots growing around a tree stump, which when it eventually rots away leaves the birch standing atop stilt-like roots"
Betula alleghaniensis, Yellow birch saplings will not establish in full shade (under a closed canopy) so they typically need disturbances in a forest in order to establish and grow
Betula alleghaniensis, The tree is fairly deep-rooted and sends out several long lateral roots

=== Similarity to Betula lenta ===
Both yellow birch and sweet birch have nearly identical leaf shape and both give an odor of wintergreen when crushed"
Betula alleghaniensis, Seedlings of the two species can be very hard to tell apart
Betula alleghaniensis," To differentiate the two, the range, buds, or bark must be examined"
Betula alleghaniensis," The ranges do overlap in Appalachia where they commonly grow together, but sweet birch does not grow west of Ohio or north into Canada whereas yellow birch does"
Betula alleghaniensis," Sweet birch also has black non-peeling bark compared to the lighter, bronze colored, peeling bark of yellow birch"
Betula alleghaniensis," For young trees where bark has not yet developed, yellow birch can also be identified by its hairy buds and stems; sweet birch has hairless buds"
Betula alleghaniensis,"


== Taxonomy ==

Betula alleghaniensis," lutea, but did confirm the existence of two varieties"
Betula alleghaniensis," Later, the name Betula lutea was determined illegitimate as it was superfluous to the older name that Michaux had listed as a synonym, Betula excelsa Aiton (1789)"
Betula alleghaniensis," Additionally, the type specimen of Betula excelsa was found not to be a yellow birch, making Betula alleghaniensis the oldest and correct replacement name for the illegitimate B"
Betula alleghaniensis, lutea
Betula alleghaniensis,"The specific epithet alleghaniensis means ""of the Allegheny Mountains"""
Betula alleghaniensis," In addition to ""yellow"" or ""golden"" birch, B"

Betula alleghaniensis, Oil of wintergreen can be distilled from the bark
Betula alleghaniensis," The papery, shredded bark, is very flammable due to its oil content and can be peeled off and used as a fire starter even in wet conditions"
Betula alleghaniensis,"Yellow birch can be tapped for syrup similarly to sugar maple, and although the sap has less sugar content, it flows in greater quantity than sugar maple"
Betula alleghaniensis," When the sap is boiled down, the wintergreen evaporates and leaves a syrup not unlike maple syrup"
Betula alleghaniensis, The sap can also be used as is in birch syrup or may be flavored
Betula alleghaniensis, Tea can also be made from the twigs and inner bark
Betula alleghaniensis,"


=== Native American ethnobotany ===

area along western Lake Ontario, and southward along the northern shore of Lake Erie and pockets of extreme southwestern Ontario"
Carya glabra,"


=== Climate ===
Pignut hickory grows in a humid climate with an average annual precipitation of 760 to 2,030 mm (30 to 80 in) of which 510 to 1,020 mm (20 to 40 in) is rain during the growing season"
Carya glabra," Average snowfall varies from little to none in the South to 2,540 mm (100 in) or more in the mountains of West Virginia, southeastern New York, and southern North Carolina (25)"

Carya glabra,"
According to one classification of climate (20), the range of pignut hickory south of the Ohio River, except for a small area in Florida, is designated as humid, mesothermal"
Carya glabra," That part of the range lying north of the Ohio River is designated humid, mesothermal"
Carya glabra," Part of the species range in peninsular Florida is classed as subhumid, mesothermal"
Carya glabra," Mountains in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee are classed as wet, microthermal, and mountains in South Carolina and Georgia are classed as wet, mesothermal"
Carya glabra," Throughout its range, precipitation is rated adequate during all seasons"
Carya glabra,"


=== Soils and topography ===
Pignut hickory frequently grows on dry ridgetops and sideslopes throughout its range but it is also common on moist sites, particularly in the mountains and Piedmont"
Carya glabra, In the Great Smoky Mountains pignut hickory has been observed on dry sandy soils at low elevations
Carya glabra," Whittaker (27) placed pignut in a submesic class and charted it as ranging up to 1480 m (4,850 ft)-the hickory with the greatest elevational range in the Great Smoky Mountains"
Carya glabra," In southwest Virginia, south-facing upper slopes from 975 to 1050 m (3,200 to 3,445 ft) of Beanfield Mountain are dominated by pignut hickory, northern red oak Quercus rubra), and white oak (Q"
Carya glabra, alba)
Carya glabra," This site is the most xeric habitat on the mountain because of high insolation, 70 percent slopes, and medium- to coarse-textured soils derived from Clinch sandstone"
Carya glabra," Mid-elevation slopes from 800 to 975 m (2,625 to 3,200 ft) are dominated by chestnut oak (Q"
Carya glabra," prinus), northern red oak, and pignut hickory and coincide with three shale formations (12)"
Carya glabra,"
The range of pignut hickory encompasses 7 orders, 12 suborders, and 22 great groups of soils (24,25)"
Carya glabra," About two-thirds of the species range is dominated by Ultisols, which are low in bases and have subsurface horizons of clay accumulation"
Carya glabra, They are usually moist but are dry during part of the warm season
Carya glabra, Udults is the dominant suborder and Hapludults and Paleudults are the dominant great groups
Carya glabra," These soils are derived from a variety of parent materials-sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, glacial till, and in places varying thickness of loess-which vary in age from Precambrian to Quaternary"
Carya glabra,"
A wide range of soil fertility exists as evidenced by soil orders-Alfisols and Mollisols which are medium to high in base saturation to Ultisols which are low in base saturation (24)"
Carya glabra," Pignut hickory responds to increases in soil nitrogen similarly to American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) (15)"
Carya glabra," These species are rated as intermediate in nitrogen deficiency tolerance and consequently are able to grow with lower levels of nitrogen than are required by ""nitrogen- demanding"" white ash (Fraxinus americana), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and American basswood (Tilia americana)"
Carya glabra," Hickories are considered ""soil improvers"" because their leaves have a relatively high calcium content"
Carya glabra,"


=== Associated forest cover ===
Hickories are consistently present in the broad eastern upland climax forest association commonly called oak-hickory, but they are not generally abundant (18)"
Carya glabra," Locally, hickories may make up to 20 to 30 percent of stand basal area, particularly in slope and cove forests below the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau (23) and in second-growth forests in the Cumberland Mountains, especially on benches (14)"
Carya glabra," It has been hypothesized that hickory will replace chestnut (Castanea dentata) killed by the blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) in the Appalachian Highlands (10,12)"
Carya glabra," On Beanfield Mountain in Giles County, Virginia, the former chestnut-oak complex has changed to an oak-hickory association over a period of 50 years"
Carya glabra, This association is dominated by pignut hickory with an importance value of 41
Carya glabra,"0 (maximum value = 300), northern red oak (36"
Carya glabra,"0), and chestnut oak (25"
Carya glabra,0)
Carya glabra," White oak, red maple (Acer rubrum), and sugar maple are subdominant species"
Carya glabra,"
Pignut hickory is an associated species in 20 of the 90 forest cover types listed by the Society of American Foresters for the eastern United States (6):

Because the range of pignut hickory is so extensive, it is not feasible to list the associated trees, shrubs, herbs, and grasses, which vary according to elevation, topographic conditions, edaphic features, and geographic locality"
Carya glabra,"


== Life history ==


=== Reproduction and early growth ===
Flowering and fruiting- Hickories are monoecious and flower in the spring (3)"
Carya glabra, The staminate catkins of pignut hickory are 8 to 18 cm (3 to 7 in) long and develop from axils of leaves of the previous season or from inner scales of the terminal buds at the base of the current growth
Carya glabra, The pistillate flowers appear in spikes about 6 mm (0
Carya glabra,25 in) long on peduncles terminating in shoots of the current year
Carya glabra, Flowers open from the middle of March in the southeast part of the range to early June in New England
Carya glabra, The catkins usually emerge before the pistillate flowers
Carya glabra,"
The fruit of hickory is pear shaped and enclosed in a thin husk developed from the floral involucre"
Carya glabra," The fruit ripens in September and October, and seeds are dispersed from September through December"
Carya glabra, Husks are green until maturity; they turn brown to brownish-black as they ripen
Carya glabra, The husks become dry at maturity and split away from the nut into four valves along sutures
Carya glabra," Husks of pignut hickory split only to the middle or slightly beyond and generally cling to the nut, which is unribbed, with a thick shell"
Carya glabra,"


=== Seed production and dissemination ===
Pignut hickory begins to bear seed in quantity in 30 years, with optimum production between 75 and 200 years (16)"
Carya glabra, The maximum age for seed production is about 300 years
Carya glabra, Good seed crops occur every year or two with light crops in other years; frost can seriously hinder seed production (22)
Carya glabra," Usually less than half of the seeds are sound (2,3), but 50 to 75 percent of these will germinate"
Carya glabra, The hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana) can seriously reduce germination
Carya glabra," Pignut seed, averaging 440/kg (200/lb), is lighter than the seed of other hickory species"
Carya glabra," The nuts are disseminated mainly by gravity, but the range of seeding is extended by squirrels and chipmunks"
Carya glabra,"


=== Seedling development ===
Hickories exhibit embryo dormancy which is overcome naturally by overwintering in the duff and litter or artificially by stratification in a moist medium at 1° to 4 °C (33° to 40 °F) for 30 to 150 days"
Carya glabra, In forest tree nurseries unstratified hickory nuts are sown in the fall and stratified nuts are sown in the spring
Carya glabra," Hickories are hypogeously germinating plants, and the nuts seldom remain viable in the forest floor for more than one winter (22)"
Carya glabra,"
Seedling growth of hickories is slow"
Carya glabra," The following height growth of pignut hickory seedlings was reported in the Ohio Valley in the open or under light shade, on red clay soil (2):


=== Vegetative reproduction ===
Hickories sprout readily from stumps and roots"
Carya glabra, Stump sprouting is not as prolific as in other deciduous trees species but the sprouts that are produced are vigorous and grow fairly rapidly in height
Carya glabra, Root sprouts also are vigorous and probably more numerous than stump sprouts in cut-over areas
Carya glabra, Small stumps sprout more frequently than large ones
Carya glabra, Sprouts that originate at or below ground level and from small stumps are less likely to develop heartwood decay
Carya glabra, Pignut hickory is difficult to reproduce from cuttings
Carya glabra,"


=== Sapling and pole stages to maturity ===
Growth and yield- Pignut hickory often grows 24 to 27 m (80 to 90 ft) tall and occasionally reaches 37 m (120 ft), with d"
Carya glabra,b
Carya glabra,h
Carya glabra, of 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in)
Carya glabra, The bole is often forked
Carya glabra, Height and diameter by age are shown in table 1 for selected locations
Carya glabra," Diameter growth of pignut hickory (along with chestnut oak, white oak, sweet birch (Betula lenta), and American beech is rated slow"
Carya glabra," Since hickories constitute 15 percent or less of the basal area of oak-hickory forest types, most growth and yield information is written in terms of oak rather than oak-hickory"
Carya glabra," Yields of mixed oak stands (5,7,19) and of hickory stands (2) have been reported"
Carya glabra," Tree volume tables are available (2,19)"
Carya glabra,"

¹Second growth"
Carya glabra,"
²Virgin forest"
Carya glabra,"


=== Rooting habit ===
Pignut hickory tends to develop a pronounced taproot with few laterals and is rated as windfirm (21)"
Carya glabra," The taproot develops early, which may explain the slow growth of seedling shoots"
Carya glabra, Taproots may develop in compact and stony soils
Carya glabra,"


=== Reaction to competition ===
The hickories as a group are classed as intermediate in shade tolerance; however, pignut hickory has been classed as intolerant in the Northeast and tolerant in the Southeast"
Carya glabra," In much of the area covered by mixed oak forests, shade-tolerant hardwoods (including the hickories) are climax, and the trend of succession toward this climax is very strong"
Carya glabra," Although most silvicultural systems when applied to oak types will maintain a hardwood forest, the cutting methods used affects the rapidity with which other species may replace the oaks and hickories (17,18,26)"
Carya glabra,"


== Damaging agents ==
Pignut hickory is easily damaged by fire, which causes stem degrade or loss of volume, or both"
Carya glabra, Internal discolorations called mineral streak are common and are one major reason why so few standing hickories meet trade specifications
Carya glabra," Streaks result from yellow-bellied sapsucker pecking, pin knots, worm holes, and mechanical injuries"
Carya glabra, Hickories strongly resist ice damage and seldom develop epicormic branches
Carya glabra,"
The Index of Plant Diseases in the United States lists 133 fungi and 10 other causes of diseases on Carya species (4,9)"
Carya glabra," Most of the fungi are saprophytes, but a few are damaging to foliage, produce cankers, or cause trunk or root rots"
Carya glabra,"
The most common disease of pignut hickory from Pennsylvania southward is a trunk rot caused by Poria spiculosa"
Carya glabra, Cankers vary in size and appearance depending on their age
Carya glabra," A common form develops around a branch wound and resembles a swollen, nearly healed wound"
Carya glabra, On large trees these may become prominent burl-like bodies having several vertical or irregular folds in the callus covering
Carya glabra," A single trunk canker near the base is a sign that the butt log is badly infected, and multiple cankers are evidence that the entire tree may be a cull"
Carya glabra,"
Major leaf diseases are anthracnose (Gnomonia caryae) and mildew (Microstroma juglandis)"
Carya glabra, The former causes brown spots with definite margins on the undersides of the leaf
Carya glabra, These may coalesce and cause widespread blotching
Carya glabra, Mildew invades the leaves and twigs and may form witches' brooms by stimulating bud formation
Carya glabra," Although locally prevalent, mildew offers no problem in the management of hickory"
Carya glabra,"
The stem canker (Nectria galligena) produces depressed areas with concentric bark rings that develop on the trunk and branches"
Carya glabra, Affected trees are sometimes eliminated through breakage or competition and sometimes live to reach merchantable size with cull section at the canker
Carya glabra," No special control measures are required, but cankered trees should be harvested in stand improvement operations"
Carya glabra,"
A gall-forming fungus species of Phomopsis can produce warty excrescences ranging from small twig galls to very large trunk burls on northern hickories and oaks"
Carya glabra, Little information is available on root diseases of hickory
Carya glabra,"
More than 100 insects have been reported to infest hickory trees and wood products, but only a few cause death or severe damage (1)"
Carya glabra," The hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) is the most important insect enemy of hickory, and also one of the most important insect pests of hardwoods in the Eastern United States"
Carya glabra," During drought periods in the Southeast, outbreaks often develop and large tracts of timber are killed"
Carya glabra," At other times, damage may be confined to the killing of a single tree or to portions of the tops of trees"
Carya glabra," The foliage of heavily infested trees turns red within a few weeks after attack, and the trees soon die"
Carya glabra, There is one generation per year in northern areas and normally two broods per year in the South
Carya glabra, Control consists of felling infested trees and destroying the bark during winter months or storing infested logs in ponds
Carya glabra,"
Logs and dying trees of several hardwood species including pignut hickory are attacked by the ambrosia beetle (Platypus quadridentatus) throughout the South and north to West Virginia and North Carolina"
Carya glabra," The false powderpost beetle (Xylobiops basilaris) attacks recently felled or dying trees, logs, or limbs with bark in the Eastern and Southern States"
Carya glabra," Hickory, persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and pecan (C"
Carya glabra," illinoinensis) are most frequently infested, but other hardwoods also are attacked"
Carya glabra, Healthy trees growing in proximity to heavily infested trees are occasionally attacked but almost always without success
Carya glabra," Hickory and persimmon wood (useful in the manufacture of small products such as shuttle blocks, mallets, and mauls is sometimes seriously damaged"
Carya glabra,"
Hickory is one of several host species of the twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata)"
Carya glabra, Infested trees and seedlings are not only damaged severely but become ragged and unattractive
Carya glabra," A few of the more common species of gall-producing insects attacking hickory are Phylloxera caryaecaulis, Caryomyia holotricha, C"
Carya glabra," sanguinolenta, and C"

Carya glabra,"


== Special uses ==
Hickories provide food to many kinds of wildlife (8,13)"
Carya glabra, The nuts are relished by several species of squirrel and represent an estimated 10 to 25 percent of their diet
Carya glabra," Hogs were observed consuming the nuts in colonial America, lending the species its common name"
Carya glabra, Nuts and flowers are eaten by the wild turkey and several species of songbirds
Carya glabra," Nuts and bark are eaten by black bears, foxes, rabbits, and raccoons"
Carya glabra, Small mammals eat the nuts and leaves; 5 to 10 percent of the diet of eastern chipmunks is hickory nuts
Carya glabra," White-tailed deer occasionally browse hickory leaves, twigs, and nuts"
Carya glabra,"
The kernel of hickory seeds is exceptionally high in crude fat, up to 70 to 80 percent in some species"
Carya glabra," Crude protein, phosphorus, and calcium contents are generally moderate to low"
Carya glabra, Crude fiber is very low
Carya glabra,"
Pignut hickory makes up a small percentage of the biomass in low-quality upland hardwood stands that are prime candidates for clearcutting for chips or fuelwood as the first step toward rehabilitation to more productive stands"
Carya glabra, Hickory has a relatively high heating value and is used extensively as a home heating fuel
Carya glabra,"
Pignut hickory is an important shade tree in wooded suburban areas over most of the range but is seldom planted as an ornamental tree because of its size and difficulty of transplanting, although it has spectacular orangey-red fall colors"
Carya glabra,"

Catalpa bignonioides," Common names include southern catalpa, cigartree, and Indian-bean-tree"
Catalpa bignonioides,"


== Description ==
It is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 15–18 metres (49–59 ft) tall, with a trunk up to 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) diameter, with brown to gray bark, maturing into hard plates or ridges"
Catalpa bignonioides, The short thick trunk supports long and straggling branches which form a broad and irregular head
Catalpa bignonioides,  The roots are fibrous and branches are brittle
Catalpa bignonioides, Its juices are watery and bitter
Catalpa bignonioides,"The leaves are large and heart shaped, being 20–30 cm long and 15–20 cm broad"
Catalpa bignonioides," The bright green leaves appear late and as they are full grown before the flower clusters open, add much to the beauty of the blossoming tree"
Catalpa bignonioides," They secrete nectar, a most unusual characteristic for leaves, by means of groups of tiny glands in the axils of the primary veins"
Catalpa bignonioides,"

The flowers are 2"
Catalpa bignonioides,"5–4 cm across, trumpet shaped, white with yellow spots inside; they grow in panicles of 20-40"
Catalpa bignonioides," In the northern states of the USA, it is a late bloomer, putting forth great panicles of white flowers in June or early in July when the flowers of other trees have mostly faded"
Catalpa bignonioides,  These cover the tree so thickly as almost to conceal the full grown leaves
Catalpa bignonioides,"  The general effect of the flower cluster is a pure white, but the individual corolla is spotted with purple and gold, and some of these spots are arranged in lines along a ridge, so as to lead directly to the honey sweets within"
Catalpa bignonioides,  A single flower when fully expanded is two inches long and an inch and a half wide
Catalpa bignonioides,"  It is two-lipped and the lips are lobed, two lobes above and three below, as is not uncommon with such corollas"
Catalpa bignonioides," The flower is perfect, possessing both stamens and pistils; nevertheless, the law of elimination is at work and of the five stamens that we should expect to find, three have aborted, ceased to bear anthers and have become filaments simply"
Catalpa bignonioides," Then, too, the flowers refuse to be self-fertilized"
Catalpa bignonioides,  Each flower has its own stamens and its own stigma but the lobes of the stigma remain closed until after the anthers have opened and discharged their pollen; after they have withered and become effete then the stigma opens and invites the wandering bee
Catalpa bignonioides, The entire Pink family behave in this way
Catalpa bignonioides,"

The fruit is a long, thin bean like pod 20–40 cm long and 8–10 mm diameter; it often stays attached to tree during winter"

Catalpa bignonioides,"
Winter buds: No terminal bud, uppermost bud is axillary"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Minute, globular, deep in the bark"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Outer scales fall when spring growth begins, inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, become green, hairy and sometimes two inches long"
Catalpa bignonioides,"
Leaves: Opposite, or in threes, simple, six to ten inches long, four to five broad"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Broadly ovate, cordate at base, entire, sometimes wavy, acute or acuminate"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Clusters of dark glands, which secrete nectar are found in the axils of the primary veins"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  They come out of the bud involute, purplish, when full grown are bright green, smooth above, pale green, and downy beneath"
Catalpa bignonioides,  When bruised they give a disagreeable odor
Catalpa bignonioides,  They turn dark and fall after the first severe frost
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Petioles stout, terete, long"
Catalpa bignonioides,"
Flowers: June, July"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Perfect, white, borne in many-flowered thyrsoid panicles, eight to ten inches long"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Pedicels slender, downy"
Catalpa bignonioides,"
Calyx: Globular and pointed in the bud; finally splitting into two, broadly ovate, entire lobes, green or light purple"
Catalpa bignonioides,"
Corolla: Campanulate, tube swollen, slightly oblique, two-lipped, five-lobed, the two lobes above smaller than the three below, imbricate in bud; limb spreading, undulate, when fully expanded is an inch and a half wide and nearly two inches long, white, marked on the inner surface with two rows of yellow blotches and in the throat on the lower lobes with purple spots"
Catalpa bignonioides,"
Stamens: Two, rarely four, inserted near the base of the corolla, introrse, slightly exserted; anthers oblong, two-celled, opening longitudinally; filaments flattened, thread-like"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Sterile filaments three, inserted near base of corolla, often rudimentary"
Catalpa bignonioides,"
Pistil: Ovary superior, two-celled; style long, thread-like, with a two-lipped stigma"
Catalpa bignonioides,  Ovules numerous
Catalpa bignonioides,"
Fruit: Long slender capsule, nearly cylindrical, two-celled, partition at right angles to the valves"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Six to twenty inches long, brown; hangs on the tree all winter, splitting before it falls"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Seeds an inch long, one-fourth of an inch wide, silvery gray, winged on each side and ends of wings fringed"
Catalpa bignonioides,"


== Induced Defenses ==
A 2003 study by J"
Catalpa bignonioides, Ness showed that when a hawkmoth caterpillar Ceratomia catalpae started eating the leaves of C
Catalpa bignonioides," bignonoides, the leaves produced extra nectar"
Catalpa bignonioides," The nectar in turn attracted a greater number of bodyguard ants Forelius pruinosus to the damaged leaves, thus giving added protection to the whole plant"
Catalpa bignonioides,"


== Distribution ==
In the USA, Catalpa bignonioides is undoubtedly a Southern tree"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Europeans first observed the tree growing in the fields of the Cherokee Native American tribes, who called it Catalpa"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  However, it can flourish in the North as well, and accordingly its original range is somewhat in doubt"

Catalpa bignonioides,"
Catalpa bignonioides contains varying levels of iridoid glycosides that deter generalist herbivores, but which are tolerated by and concentrated in Ceratomia catalpae caterpillars"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  These caterpillars have a longstanding ecological relationship with the tree, and may defoliate a tree three or more times in a summer without killing it"
Catalpa bignonioides,"  Fishing enthusiasts prize the caterpillars as bait, particularly for catfish, and may freeze them for months after collecting them in the spring"
Catalpa bignonioides,It is one of two parents of the interspecific hybrid tree × Chitalpa tashkentensis
Catalpa bignonioides,  The other parent is Chilopsis linearis
Catalpa bignonioides," The cross was done by a Russian in Tashkent, Uzbekistan"

Ficus carica,"Ficus carica is an Asian species of flowering plant in the mulberry family, known as the common fig (or just the fig)"
Ficus carica, It is the source of the fruit also called the fig and as such is an important crop in those areas where it is grown commercially
Ficus carica," Native to the Middle East and western Asia, it has been sought out and cultivated since ancient times and is now widely grown throughout the world, both for its fruit and as an ornamental plant"
Ficus carica, The species has become naturalized in scattered locations in Asia and North America
Ficus carica,"


== Etymology ==
The word fig, first recorded in English in the 13th century, derives from (Old) French figue, itself from Occitan (Provençal) figa, from Romance *fica, from Classical Latin ficus (fig or fig-tree)"
Ficus carica," Italian has fico, directly derived from Latin ficus"
Ficus carica," The name of the caprifig, Ficus caprificus Risso, is derived both from Latin capro (billygoat) and English fig"
Ficus carica,"


== Biology ==


=== Description ===
Ficus carica is a gynodioecious, i"
Ficus carica, e
Ficus carica,", functionally dioecious, deciduous tree or large shrub that grows up to 7–10 metres (23–33 ft) tall, with smooth white bark"
Ficus carica, Its fragrant foliage is 12–25 centimetres (4
Ficus carica,7–9
Ficus carica,8 in) long and 10–18 centimetres (3
Ficus carica,9–7
Ficus carica,"1 in) wide, and deeply lobed with 3 or 5 lobes"
Ficus carica," The complex inflorescence consists of a hollow fleshy structure denominated the ""syconium"", which is lined with numerous unisexual flowers"
Ficus carica, The flowers are not visible outside the syconium because they bloom inside the infructescence
Ficus carica," Although commonly denominated a ""fruit"", the fig is in truth the infructescence or scion of the tree, known as a ""false fruit"" or ""multiple fruit"", which bears the flowers and seeds"
Ficus carica, It is a hollow-ended stem that contains many flowers
Ficus carica," The small orifice, denominated the ""ostiole"", that is visible on the middle of the fruit is a narrow passage, which allows the specialized fig wasp, Blastophaga psenes to enter the fruit and pollinate the flowers, after which the fruit grows seeds"
Ficus carica, See Ficus: Fig fruit and reproduction system
Ficus carica,"
The edible fruit consists of the mature syconium that contains numerous one-seeded fruits, denominated ""druplets"""
Ficus carica, The fruit is 3–5 centimetres (1
Ficus carica,2–2
Ficus carica,"0 in) long, with a green skin that sometimes ripens toward purple or brown"
Ficus carica," Ficus carica has milky sap, thus rendering it a laticifer"
Ficus carica, The sap of the green parts is an irritant to human skin
Ficus carica,"


=== Habitat ===

The common fig tree has been cultivated since ancient times and grows wild in dry and sunny locations with deep and fresh soil, and in rocky locations that are at sea level to 1,700 metres in elevation"
Ficus carica," It prefers relatively porous and freely draining soil, and can grow in nutritionally poor soil"
Ficus carica," Unlike other fig species, Ficus carica does not always require pollination by a wasp or from another tree, because the fig wasp, Blastophaga psenes can pollinate it so as to produce seeds"
Ficus carica," Fig wasps are not present to pollinate in colder nations, e"
Ficus carica, g
Ficus carica, the United Kingdom
Ficus carica,"

The plant tolerates seasonal drought, and the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean climates are especially suitable to it"
Ficus carica," Situated in a favorable habitat, mature specimens can grow to considerable size as large, dense, shade trees"
Ficus carica," Its aggressive root system precludes its cultivation in many urban locations, yet in nature this characteristic helps the plant to root in the most inhospitable locations"
Ficus carica," Having a great need of water, it is mostly a phreatophyte that extracts the needed water from sources in or on the ground"
Ficus carica," Consequently, it frequently grows in locations with standing or running water, e"
Ficus carica, g
Ficus carica, in valleys of rivers and in ravines that collect water
Ficus carica," The deeply rooted plant searches for groundwater in aquifers, ravines, or cracks in rocks"
Ficus carica," With access to this water, the tree cools the hot environments in which it grows, thus producing fresh and pleasant habitat for many animals that shelter in its shade during periods of intense heat"
Ficus carica,"
The mountain or rock fig (""Anjeer Kohi"", انجیر کوهی, in Persian) is a wild variety, tolerant of cold dry climates, of the semi-arid rocky montane regions of Iran, especially in the Kohestan Mountains of Khorasan"
Ficus carica,"


=== Ecology ===
Ficus carica is dispersed by birds and mammals that scatter their seeds in droppings"
Ficus carica," Fig fruit is an important food source for much of the fauna in some areas, and the tree owes its expansion to those that feed on its fruit"
Ficus carica, The common fig tree also sprouts from the root and stolon tissues
Ficus carica,"
The infructescence is pollinated by a symbiosis with a fig wasp (Blastophaga psenes)"
Ficus carica," The fertilized female wasp enters the fig through the scion, which has a tiny hole in the crown (the ostiole)"
Ficus carica, She crawls on the inflorescence inside the fig and pollinates some of the female flowers
Ficus carica, She lays her eggs inside some of the flowers and dies
Ficus carica," After weeks of development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before females through holes they produce by chewing the galls"
Ficus carica, The male wasps then fertilize the females by depositing semen in the hole in the gall
Ficus carica, The males later return to the females and enlarge the holes to enable the females to emerge
Ficus carica," Then some males enlarge holes in the scion, which enables females to disperse after collecting pollen from the developed male flowers"
Ficus carica," Females have a short time (<48 hours) to find another fig tree with receptive scions to spread the pollen, assist the tree in reproduction, and lay their own eggs to start a new cycle"
Ficus carica,"


== Cultivation ==


=== From ancient times ===

The edible fig is one of the first plants that was cultivated by humans"
Ficus carica," Nine subfossil figs of a parthenocarpic (and therefore sterile) type dating to about 9400–9200 BCE were found in the early Neolithic village Gilgal I (in the Jordan Valley, 13 km north of Jericho)"
Ficus carica," The find precedes the domestication of wheat, barley, and legumes, and may thus be the first known instance of agriculture"
Ficus carica," It is proposed that this sterile but desirable type was planted and cultivated intentionally, one thousand years before the next crops were domesticated (wheat and rye)"
Ficus carica,"Figs were widespread in ancient Greece, and their cultivation was described by both Aristotle and Theophrastus"
Ficus carica," Aristotle noted that as in animal sexes, figs have individuals of two kinds, one (the cultivated fig) that bears fruit, and one (the wild caprifig) that assists the other to bear fruit"
Ficus carica," Further, Aristotle recorded that the fruits of the wild fig contain psenes (fig wasps); these begin life as larvae, and the adult psen splits its ""skin"" (pupa) and flies out of the fig to find and enter a cultivated fig, saving it from dropping"
Ficus carica," Theophrastus observed that just as date palms have male and female flowers, and that farmers (from the East) help by scattering ""dust"" from the male on to the female, and as a male fish releases his milt over the female's eggs, so Greek farmers tie wild figs to cultivated trees"
Ficus carica," They do not say directly that figs reproduce sexually, however"
Ficus carica,Figs were also a common food source for the Romans
Ficus carica," Cato the Elder, in his c"
Ficus carica," 160 BCE De Agri Cultura, lists several strains of figs grown at the time he wrote his handbook: the Mariscan, African, Herculanean, Saguntine, and the black Tellanian (De agri cultura, ch"
Ficus carica, 8)
Ficus carica," The fruits were used, among other things, to fatten geese for the production of a precursor of foie gras"
Ficus carica," Rome's first emperor, Augustus, was reputed to have been poisoned with figs from his garden smeared with poison by his wife Livia"
Ficus carica," For this reason, or perhaps because of her horticultural expertise, a variety of fig known as the Liviana was cultivated in Roman gardens"
Ficus carica,"It was cultivated from Afghanistan to Portugal, also grown in Pithoragarh in the Kumaon hills of India"
Ficus carica," From the 15th century onwards, it was grown in areas including Northern Europe and the New World"
Ficus carica," In the 16th century, Cardinal Reginald Pole introduced fig trees to Lambeth Palace in London"
Ficus carica,"
In 1769, Spanish missionaries led by Junipero Serra brought the first figs to California"
Ficus carica," The Mission variety, which they cultivated, is still popular"

Ficus carica,"


=== Introduction to California ===
As the population of California grew, especially after the gold rush, a number of other cultivars were brought there by persons and nurserymen from the east coast of the US and from France and England"
Ficus carica," By the end of the 19th century, it became apparent that California had the potential for being an ideal fig producing state because of its Mediterranean-like climate and latitude of 38 degrees, lining up San Francisco with Smyrna, Turkey"
Ficus carica, G
Ficus carica, P
Ficus carica, Rixford first brought true Smyrna figs to California in 1880
Ficus carica," The San Francisco Bulletin Company amplified the effort, which sought to introduce new cultivars from Smyrna and distribute the cuttings to the bulletin's subscribers, in expectation of receiving reports from the subscribers of which cultivars were most suitable for California"
Ficus carica," In 1881, some 14,000 cuttings were shipped in good condition to California and distributed to Bulletin Company subscribers as promised"
Ficus carica," However, none of the trees planted produced mature fruit"
Ficus carica," George Roeding concluded that this was because of the lack of pollination, as the insect pollinator was not present in California"
Ficus carica," After failed attempts, wild fig trees that carried fig wasps were successfully introduced to California on 6 April 1899, to permit production of Smyrna-type figs"
Ficus carica,"The most popular cultivar of Smyrna-type fig is Calimyrna, being a name that combines ""California"" and ""Smyrna"""
Ficus carica," The cultivar, however, is not one that was produced by a breeding program, and instead is from one of the cuttings brought to California in the latter part of the 19th century"
Ficus carica, It is identical to the cultivar Lob Injir that has been grown in Turkey for centuries
Ficus carica,"


=== Overwintering ===
The Italian diaspora that lives in cold-winter climates has a practice of burying imported fig trees to overwinter them and protect the fruiting hard wood from cold"
Ficus carica," Italian immigrants in the 19th century introduced this common practice in cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Toronto, where winters are normally too cold to leave the tree exposed"
Ficus carica," This practice consists in digging a trench that is appropriate to the size of the specimen, some of which are more than 10 feet tall, severing part of the root system, and bending the specimen into the trench"
Ficus carica," Specimens are often wrapped in waterproof material to discourage development of mould and fungus, then covered with a heavy layer of soil and leaves"
Ficus carica, Sometimes plywood or corrugated metal is placed on top to secure the tree
Ficus carica, In borderline climates like New York City burying trees is no longer needed because low winter temperatures have increased
Ficus carica," Often specimens are simply wrapped in plastic and other insulating material, or not protected if planted in a sheltered site against a wall that reflects sunlight"
Ficus carica,"


=== Modern ===

The common fig is grown for its edible fruit throughout the temperate world"
Ficus carica," It is also grown as an ornamental tree, and in the UK the cultivars 'Brown Turkey' and ‘Ice Crystal’ (mainly grown for its unusual foliage) have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit"
Ficus carica,"Figs are also grown in Germany, mainly in private gardens inside built up areas"
Ficus carica, There is no commercial fig growing
Ficus carica," The Palatine region in the German South West has an estimated 80,000 fig trees"
Ficus carica, The variety Brown Turkey is the most widespread in the region
Ficus carica, There are about a dozen quite widespread varieties hardy enough to survive winter outdoors mostly without special protection
Ficus carica," There are even two local varieties, ""Martinsfeige"" and ""Lussheim"", which may be the hardiest varieties in the region"
Ficus carica,Figs can be found in continental climates with hot summers as far north as Hungary and Moravia
Ficus carica," Thousands of cultivars, most named, have been developed as human migration brought the fig to many places outside its natural range"
Ficus carica, Fig plants can be propagated by seed or by vegetative methods
Ficus carica," Vegetative propagation is quicker and more reliable, as it does not yield the inedible caprifigs"
Ficus carica, Seeds germinate readily in moist conditions and grow rapidly once established
Ficus carica," For vegetative propagation, shoots with buds can be planted in well-watered soil in the spring or summer, or a branch can be scratched to expose the bast (inner bark) and pinned to the ground to allow roots to develop"
Ficus carica,Two crops of figs can be produced each year
Ficus carica, The first or breba crop develops in the spring on last year's shoot growth
Ficus carica, The main fig crop develops on the current year's shoot growth and ripens in the late summer or fall
Ficus carica," The main crop is generally superior in quantity and quality, but some cultivars such as 'Black Mission', 'Croisic', and 'Ventura' produce good breba crops"
Ficus carica,"
There are three types of edible figs:
Persistent (or common) figs have all female flowers that do not need pollination for fruiting; the fruit can develop through parthenocarpic means"
Ficus carica, This is a popular horticulture fig for home gardeners
Ficus carica," Dottato (Kadota), Black Mission, Brown Turkey, Brunswick, and Celeste are some representative cultivars"
Ficus carica,"
Caducous (or Smyrna) figs require cross pollination by the fig wasp with pollen from caprifigs for the fruit to mature"
Ficus carica, If not pollinated the immature fruits drop
Ficus carica," Some cultivars are Marabout, Inchàrio, and Zidi"
Ficus carica,"
Intermediate (or San Pedro) figs set an unpollinated breba crop but need pollination for the later main crop"
Ficus carica," Examples are Lampeira, King, and San Pedro"
Ficus carica,"There are dozens of fig cultivars, including main and Breba cropping varieties, and an edible caprifig (the Croisic)"
Ficus carica," Varieties are often local, found in a single region of one country"
Ficus carica,"


=== Breeding ===
While the fig contains more naturally occurring varieties than any other tree crop, a formal breeding program was not developed until the beginning of the 20th century"
Ficus carica," Ira Condit, ""High Priest of the Fig,"" and William Storey tested some thousands of fig seedlings in the early 20th century based at University of California, Riverside"
Ficus carica," It was then continued at the University of California, Davis"
Ficus carica," However, the fig breeding program was ultimately closed in the 1980s"
Ficus carica,"Due to insect and fungal disease pressure in both dried and fresh figs, the breeding program was revived in 1989 by James Doyle and Louise Ferguson using the germplasm established at UC Riverside by Ira Condit and William Storey"
Ficus carica," Crosses were made and two new varieties are now in production in California: the public variety ""Sierra"", and the patented variety ""Sequoia"""
Ficus carica,"


== Production ==
In 2017, world production of raw figs was 1"
Ficus carica,"15 million tonnes, led by Turkey with 26% of the world total, Egypt, and Morocco, as the three largest producers which collectively accounted for 54% of global production"
Ficus carica,"


== Food ==
Figs can be eaten fresh or dried, and used in jam-making"
Ficus carica," Most commercial production is in dried or otherwise processed forms, since the ripe fruit does not transport well, and once picked does not keep well"
Ficus carica, The widely produced fig roll is a biscuit (cookie) with a filling made from figs
Ficus carica,"
Fresh figs are in season from August through to early October"
Ficus carica," Fresh figs used in cooking should be plump and soft, and without bruising or splits"
Ficus carica," If they smell sour, the figs have become over-ripe"
Ficus carica, Slightly under-ripe figs can be kept at room temperature for 1–2 days to ripen before serving
Ficus carica, Figs are most flavorful at room temperature
Ficus carica,"


=== Nutrition ===

Raw figs are a good source (14% of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber per 100-gram serving (74 calories), but otherwise do not supply essential nutrients in significant content (see table)"
Ficus carica,"
In a 100-gram serving providing 229 calories, dried figs are a rich source (more than 20% DV) of dietary fiber and the essential mineral manganese (26% DV), while several other dietary minerals are in moderate-to-low content"
Ficus carica,"


== Research and folk medicine ==


=== Phytochemicals ===
Figs contain diverse phytochemicals under basic research for their potential biological properties, including polyphenols, such as gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, syringic acid, (+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin and rutin"
Ficus carica," Fig color may vary between cultivars due to various concentrations of anthocyanins, with cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside having particularly high content"
Ficus carica,"


=== Folk medicine ===
In some old Mediterranean folk practices, the milky sap of the fig plant was used to soften calluses, remove warts, and deter parasites"
Ficus carica,"


== Toxicity ==
Like other plant species in the family Moraceae, contact with the milky sap of Ficus carica followed by exposure to ultraviolet light can cause phytophotodermatitis, a potentially serious skin inflammation"
Ficus carica," Although the plant is not poisonous per se, F"
Ficus carica, carica is listed in the FDA Database of Poisonous Plants
Ficus carica,Organic chemical compounds called furanocoumarins are known to cause phytophotodermatitis in humans
Ficus carica," The common fig contains significant quantities of two furanocoumarins, psoralen and bergapten"
Ficus carica," The essential oil of fig leaves contains more than 10% psoralen, the highest concentration of any organic compound isolated from fig leaves"
Ficus carica, Psoralen appears to be the primary furanocoumarin compound responsible for fig leaf-induced phytophotodermatitis
Ficus carica,"
Psoralen and bergapten are found chiefly in the milky sap of the leaves and shoots of F"
Ficus carica, carica but not the fruits
Ficus carica, Neither psoralen nor bergapten were detected in the essential oil of fig fruits
Ficus carica, Thus there is no conclusive evidence that fig fruits cause phytophotodermatitis
Ficus carica,"


== In religion and mythology ==

In the Biblical Book of Genesis, Adam and Eve clad themselves with fig leaves (Genesis 3:7) after eating the ""forbidden fruit"" from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"

Gymnocladus dioicus,"
Rooting Habit, ""Tap Root in proportion like a carrot"""
Gymnocladus dioicus, A seedling tree grows many times in root length to its growth upward in height
Gymnocladus dioicus, The Kentucky coffee tree is not commonly offered in the nursery trade because the taproot makes the tree somewhat difficult to transplant
Gymnocladus dioicus, Being in the Legume family the roots fix nitrogen in the soil
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
The Kentucky coffeetree is believed to be an example of evolutionary anachronism"
Gymnocladus dioicus," The tough, leathery seed pods are too difficult for many animals to chew through (in addition to being poisonous) and they are too heavy for either wind or water dispersal"
Gymnocladus dioicus," It is thus believed that the tree would have been browsed upon by now-extinct mammoths and mastodons which ate the pods and nicked the seeds with their large teeth, aiding in germination"
Gymnocladus dioicus, This behavior is seen among African elephants eating Fabaceae relatives in Africa
Gymnocladus dioicus," Because of this, its prehistoric range may have been much larger than it has been in historical times"
Gymnocladus dioicus," Today, in the wild, it only grows well in wetlands, and it is thought that only in such wet conditions can the seed pods rot away to allow germination in the absence of large herbivores"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"


== Taxonomy ==
Gymnocladus is derived from the Ancient Greek κλάδος (kládos) ""branch"" and γυμνός (gumnós) ""naked"" and refers to the stout branchlets unclothed with small twigs"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
It is one of three species in the genus Gymnocladus, the other two being native to eastern Asia"
Gymnocladus dioicus," These are Chinese coffeetree Gymnocladus chinensis in central China, and Burmese coffeetree Gymnocladus burmanicus in Burma"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
The name is sometimes hyphenated as 'coffee-tree'; the form 'coffeetree' here is as used officially by the United States Forest Service"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"


== Distribution ==
The Kentucky coffeetree is considered a rare tree species"
Gymnocladus dioicus," ""Rare species are those that are so uncommon that they should be monitored to determine whether their populations are becoming threatened"
Gymnocladus dioicus,""" It is widely distributed, but rare"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
The tree's native range is limited, occurring from Southern Ontario, Canada and in the United States from Kentucky (where it was first encountered by Europeans) and western Pennsylvania in the east, to Kansas, eastern Nebraska, and southeastern South Dakota in the west, to southern Wisconsin and Michigan in the north, and to northern Louisiana in the south"
Gymnocladus dioicus," It is planted as an urban shade tree across the United States and eastern Canada, including California"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
This tree usually occurs as widely dispersed individuals or small colonial groups with interconnected root systems"
Gymnocladus dioicus, This tree is found in floodplains and river valleys but is also sometimes seen on rocky hillsides and limestone woods
Gymnocladus dioicus," In the northeastern part of its range, seemingly natural groves of this tree are actually associated with known prehistoric village sites"
Gymnocladus dioicus," In some parts of its range, this tree may be used as an indicator of the presence of limestone or of calcareous soils"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"


== Uses ==


=== Cultivation ===
Gymnocladus dioicus is cultivated by specialty tree plant nurseries as an ornamental tree for planting in gardens and parks"
Gymnocladus dioicus," The peculiarly late-emerging and early-dropping leaves, coupled with the fact that the large leaves mean few twigs in the winter profile, make it a tree that is ideal for urban shading where winter sunlight is to be maximized (such as in proximity to solar hot-air systems)"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
It is often planted because of its unique appearance and interesting character"
Gymnocladus dioicus," There are several Kentucky coffeetrees at Mount Vernon, in the gardens along the path leading up to the house of George Washington"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
Trees prefer a rich moist soil, such as bottom lands"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"  Their growth is largely unaffected by heat, cold, drought, insects, disease, road salt, ice, and alkaline soil"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
Kentucky coffeetree is easy to grow from seed"
Gymnocladus dioicus," Filing the seedcoat by hand with a small file, and then soaking the seeds in water for 24 hours will ensure rapid germination"
Gymnocladus dioicus, Propagation is also easy from dormant root cuttings from December through March
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
The Kentucky coffeetree is typically found on ""alluvial soils of river and flood plains and nearby terraces"""
Gymnocladus dioicus," Here it can form large clonal colonies, reproducing by shoots sprouting from roots"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"


=== Food ===
The beans of the tree were eaten, after roasting, in the Meskwaki (Fox), Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) and Pawnee Native American cultures"
Gymnocladus dioicus,The Meskwaki also drank the roasted ground seeds in a hot beverage similar to coffee
Gymnocladus dioicus," The common name ""coffeetree"" derives from this latter use of the roasted seeds, which was imitated by settlers because it seemed a substitute for coffee, especially in times of poverty, similar to chicory"
Gymnocladus dioicus," The European colonialists, however, considered it inferior to ""real"" coffee:

The pods, preserved like those of the tamarind, can be eaten and are slightly aperient (laxative)"
Gymnocladus dioicus," Roasting the pods and seeds neutralizes the cytisine, the toxic
alkaloid"
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
ToxicityCaution should be used when consuming, as unroasted or only partially roasted beans and pods are considered poisonous and are reputed to contain the alkaloid cytisine"
Gymnocladus dioicus,The plant is toxic to some animals
Gymnocladus dioicus,"


=== Culture ===
In addition to use as a food, the seeds of Kentucky coffeetree were used by Native Americans for ceremonial and recreational purposes"
Gymnocladus dioicus,  Seeds were used as dice in [games of chance] that were common in eastern tribes
Gymnocladus dioicus,  The seeds were also used in jewelry
Gymnocladus dioicus,"  Because of the importance of Kentucky coffeetree to Native Americans, they undoubtedly contributed to its dispersal"
Gymnocladus dioicus,Gymnocladus dioicus is used as a street tree as far north as Montréal  Québec
Gymnocladus dioicus, It resists well harsh winters and de-icing salts
Gymnocladus dioicus,"


=== Woodworking ===
The wood is used both by cabinetmakers and carpenters"
Gymnocladus dioicus, It has very little sapwood
Gymnocladus dioicus,"


== Notable specimens ==
A specimen with a height of 26 metres (85 ft) was referenced in La Turpinerie, commune of Geay, a short distance from the Charente river in south-west France, growing in a typical calcareous soil (see Minutes of Congrès international de sylviculture de Paris, June 1900)"
Gymnocladus dioicus," Cut during the 20th century, it had a circumference of 2"
Gymnocladus dioicus,8 metres (9 ft 2 in) and was the tallest in the country at this time
Gymnocladus dioicus,"
A Kentucky coffeetree, said to have been brought to the UK in 1812, stands in Mountsfield Park in the London Borough of Lewisham"

Juglans cinerea,"Juglans cinerea, commonly known as butternut or white walnut, is a species of walnut native to the eastern United States and southeast Canada"
Juglans cinerea,"


== Distribution ==
The distribution range of J"
Juglans cinerea," cinerea extends east to New Brunswick, and from southern Quebec west to Minnesota, south to northern Alabama and southwest to northern Arkansas"
Juglans cinerea, It is absent from most of the Southern United States
Juglans cinerea," The species also proliferates at middle elevations (about 2,000 ft or 610 m above sea level) in the Columbia River basin, Pacific Northwest; as an off-site species"
Juglans cinerea, Trees with 7 ft or 2
Juglans cinerea,"1 m (over mature) class range diameter at breast height were noted in the Imnaha River drainage as late as January 26, 2015"
Juglans cinerea, Butternut favors a cooler climate than black walnut and its range does not extend into the Deep South
Juglans cinerea, Its northern range extends into Wisconsin and Minnesota where the growing season is too short for black walnut
Juglans cinerea,"


== Description ==
J"
Juglans cinerea," cinerea is a deciduous tree growing to 20 m (66 ft) tall, rarely 40 m (130 ft)"
Juglans cinerea," Butternut is a slow-growing species, and rarely lives longer than 75 years"
Juglans cinerea,"  It has a 40–80 cm (16–31 in) stem diameter, with light gray bark"
Juglans cinerea,"
The leaves are alternate and pinnate, 40–70 cm (16–28 in) long, with 11–17 leaflets, each leaflet 5–10 cm (2–4 in) long and 3–5 cm (1 1⁄4–2 in) broad"
Juglans cinerea, Leaves have a terminal leaflet at the end of the leafstalk and have an odd number of leaflets
Juglans cinerea," The whole leaf is downy-pubescent, and a somewhat brighter, yellower green than many other tree leaves"
Juglans cinerea,"


=== Flowering and fruiting ===

Like other members of the Juglandaceae family, butternut's leafout in spring is tied to photoperiod rather than air temperature and occurs when daylight length reaches 14 hours"
Juglans cinerea, This can vary by up to a month in the northern and southernmost extents of its range
Juglans cinerea, Leaf drop in fall is early and is initiated when daylight drops to 11 hours
Juglans cinerea, The species is monoecious
Juglans cinerea," Male (staminate) flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green slender catkins that develop from auxiliary buds and female (pistillate) flowers are short terminal spikes on current year's shoots"
Juglans cinerea, Each female flower has a light pink stigma
Juglans cinerea, Flowers of both sexes do not usually mature simultaneously on any individual tree
Juglans cinerea,"
The fruit is a lemon-shaped nut, produced in bunches of two to six together; the nut is oblong-ovoid, 3–6 cm (1 1⁄4–2 1⁄4 in) long and 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1 1⁄2 in) broad, surrounded by a green husk before maturity in midautumn"
Juglans cinerea,"


== Ecology ==


=== Soil and topography ===
Butternut grows best on stream banks and on well-drained soils"
Juglans cinerea," It is seldom found on dry, compact, or infertile soils"
Juglans cinerea," It grows better than black walnut, however, on dry, rocky soils, especially those of limestone origin"
Juglans cinerea, Butternut's range includes the rocky soils of New England where black walnut is largely absent
Juglans cinerea,"
Butternut is found most frequently in coves, on stream benches and terraces, on slopes, in the talus of rock ledges, and on other sites with good drainage"
Juglans cinerea," It is found up to an elevation of 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) in the Virginias – much higher altitudes than black walnut"
Juglans cinerea,"


=== Associated forest cover ===
Butternut is found with many other tree species in several hardwood types in the mixed mesophytic forest"
Juglans cinerea," It is an associated species in the following four northern and central forest cover types: sugar maple–basswood, yellow poplar–white oak–northern red oak, beech–sugar maple, and river birch–sycamore"
Juglans cinerea, Commonly associated trees include basswood (Tilia spp
Juglans cinerea,"), black cherry (Prunus serotina), beech (Fagus grandifolia), black walnut (Juglans nigra), elm (Ulmus spp"
Juglans cinerea,"), hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), hickory (Carya spp"
Juglans cinerea,"), oak (Quercus spp"
Juglans cinerea,"), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis)"
Juglans cinerea," In the northeast part of its range, it is often found with sweet birch (Betula lenta) and in the northern part of its range it is occasionally found with white pine (Pinus strobus)"
Juglans cinerea," Forest stands seldom contain more than an occasional butternut tree, although in local areas, it may be abundant"
Juglans cinerea," In the past, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Tennessee have been the leading producers of butternut timber"
Juglans cinerea,"


==== Canopy competition ====
Although young trees may withstand competition from the side, butternut does not survive under shade from above"
Juglans cinerea, It must be in the overstory to thrive
Juglans cinerea," Therefore, it is classed as intolerant of shade and competition"
Juglans cinerea,"


=== Diseases ===


==== Butternut canker ====
The most serious disease of J"
Juglans cinerea, cinerea is butternut decline or butternut canker
Juglans cinerea," In the past, the causal organism of this disease was thought to be a fungus, Melanconis juglandis"
Juglans cinerea," Now this fungus has been associated with secondary infections and the primary causal organism of the disease has been identified as another species of fungus, Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum"
Juglans cinerea," The fungus is spread by wide-ranging vectors, so isolation of a tree offers no protection"
Juglans cinerea,"
Butternut canker first entered the United States around the beginning of the 20th century, when it arrived on imported nursery stock of Japanese walnut"
Juglans cinerea,"
Symptoms of the disease include dying branches and stems"
Juglans cinerea," Initially, cankers develop on branches in the lower crown"
Juglans cinerea, Spores developing on these dying branches are spread by rainwater to tree stems
Juglans cinerea, Stem cankers develop 1 to 3 years after branches die
Juglans cinerea, Tree tops killed by stem-girdling cankers do not resprout
Juglans cinerea, Diseased trees usually die within several years
Juglans cinerea, Completely free-standing trees seem better able to withstand the fungus than those growing in dense stands or forest
Juglans cinerea," In some areas, 90% of the butternut trees have been killed"
Juglans cinerea, The disease is reported to have eliminated butternut from North and South Carolina
Juglans cinerea, The disease is also reported to be spreading rapidly in Wisconsin
Juglans cinerea," By contrast, black walnut seems to be resistant to the disease"
Juglans cinerea,"


==== Hybrid resistance ====
Butternut hybridizes readily with Japanese walnut"
Juglans cinerea, The hybrid between butternut and the Japanese walnut is commonly known as the 'buartnut' and inherits Japanese walnut's resistance to the disease
Juglans cinerea," Researchers are back-crossing butternut to buartnut, creating 'butter-buarts"" which should have more butternut traits than buartnuts"
Juglans cinerea, They are selecting for resistance to the disease
Juglans cinerea, Most butternuts found as landscaping trees are buartnuts rather than the pure species
Juglans cinerea,"


==== Other pests ====
Bunch disease also attacks butternut"
Juglans cinerea," Currently, the causal agent is thought to be a mycoplasma-like organism"
Juglans cinerea, Symptoms include a yellow witches' broom resulting from sprouting and growth of auxiliary buds that would normally remain dormant
Juglans cinerea, Infected branches fail to become dormant in the fall and are killed by frost; highly susceptible trees may eventually be killed
Juglans cinerea, Butternut seems to be more susceptible to this disease than black walnut
Juglans cinerea,"
The common grackle has been reported to destroy immature fruit and may be considered a butternut pest when populations are high"
Juglans cinerea,"
Butternut is very susceptible to fire damage, and although the species is generally wind firm, it is subject to frequent storm damage"
Juglans cinerea,"


=== Conservation ===
The species is not listed as threatened federally in the US, but is listed as ""Special Concern"" in Kentucky, ""Exploitably Vulnerable"" in New York State, and ""Threatened"" in Tennessee"
Juglans cinerea,The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada placed the butternut on the endangered species list in Canada in 2005
Juglans cinerea,"


== Famous specimens ==
The American Forest National Champion is located in Oneida, New York"
Juglans cinerea," In 2016 its circumference at breast height was 288 in (7,300 mm), the height was 67 ft (20 m), and the spread was 88 ft (27 m)"
Juglans cinerea,"In Louisa May Alcott's Little Men (1871) the two youngest boys, Rob and Teddy, have an amusing running battle with the squirrels over collecting the butternuts"
Juglans cinerea,"

""Bush butternut"" was planted by settler George Bush (1845) in current Tumwater, Washington state brought from Missouri"
Juglans cinerea, This tree stands living in 2019
Juglans cinerea,"


== Uses ==

The butternuts are eaten by wildlife and were made into oil by Native Americans for various purposes, including anointment"
Juglans cinerea, The husks contain a natural yellow-orange dye
Juglans cinerea,"


=== Lumber ===
Butternut wood is light in weight and takes polish well, and is highly rot resistant, but is much softer than black walnut wood"
Juglans cinerea," Oiled, the grain of the wood usually shows much light"
Juglans cinerea,"  It is often used to make furniture, and is a favorite of woodcarvers"
Juglans cinerea,"


=== Fabric dye ===
Butternut bark and nut rinds were once often used to dye cloth to colors between light yellow and dark brown"
Juglans cinerea,"  To produce the darker colors, the bark is boiled to concentrate the color"
Juglans cinerea," This appears to never have been used as a commercial dye, but rather was used to color homespun cloth"
Juglans cinerea,"
In the mid-19th century, inhabitants of areas such as southern Illinois and southern Indiana – many of whom had moved there from the Southern United States – were known as ""butternuts"" from the butternut-dyed homespun cloth that some of them wore"
Juglans cinerea,"  Later, during the American Civil War, the term ""butternut"" was sometimes applied to Confederate soldiers"
Juglans cinerea, Some Confederate uniforms apparently faded from gray to a tan or light brown
Juglans cinerea,  It is also possible that butternut was used to color the cloth worn by a small number of Confederate soldiers
Juglans cinerea,"  The resemblance of these uniforms to butternut-dyed clothing, and the association of butternut dye with home-made clothing, resulted in this derisive nickname"
Juglans cinerea,"


=== Fishing ===
Crushed fruits can be used to poison fish, though the practice is illegal in most jurisdictions"
Juglans cinerea, Bruised fruit husks of the closely related black walnut can be used to stun fish

Liriodendron tulipifera,"A description from Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them by Harriet Louise Keeler:
The leaves are of unusual shape and develop in a most peculiar and characteristic manner"
Liriodendron tulipifera," The leaf-buds are composed of scales as is usual, and these scales grow with the growing shoot"
Liriodendron tulipifera," In this respect the buds do not differ from those of many other trees, but what is peculiar is that each pair of scales develops so as to form an oval envelope which contains the young leaf and protects it against changing temperatures until it is strong enough to sustain them without injury"
Liriodendron tulipifera," When it has reached that stage the bracts separate, the tiny leaf comes out carefully folded along the line of the midrib, opens as it matures, and until it becomes full grown the bracts do duty as stipules, becoming an inch or more in length before they fall"
Liriodendron tulipifera," The leaf is unique in shape, its apex is cut off at the end in a way peculiarly its own, the petioles are long, angled, and so poised that the leaves flutter independently, and their glossy surfaces so catch and toss the light that the effect of the foliage as a whole is much brighter than it otherwise would be"

== Taxonomy and naming ==

Originally described by Carl Linnaeus, Liriodendron tulipifera is one of two species (see also L"
Liriodendron tulipifera, chinense) in the genus Liriodendron in the magnolia family
Liriodendron tulipifera," The name Liriodendron is Greek for ""lily tree"""
Liriodendron tulipifera," It is also called the tuliptree Magnolia, or sometimes, by the lumber industry, as the tulip-poplar or yellow-poplar"
Liriodendron tulipifera," However, it is not closely related to true lilies, tulips or poplars"
Liriodendron tulipifera,"
The tulip tree has impressed itself upon popular attention in many ways, and consequently has many common names"
Liriodendron tulipifera," The tree's traditional name in the Miami-Illinois language is ""oonseentia"""
Liriodendron tulipifera, Native Americans so habitually made their dugout canoes of its trunk that the early settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains called it Canoewood
Liriodendron tulipifera, The color of its wood gives it the name Whitewood
Liriodendron tulipifera," In areas near the Mississippi River it is called a poplar largely because of the fluttering habits of its leaves, in which it resembles trees of that genus"
Liriodendron tulipifera," It is sometimes called ""fiddle tree,"" because its peculiar leaves, with their arched bases and in-cut sides, suggest the violin shape"
Liriodendron tulipifera,The external resemblance of its flowers to tulips named it the Tulip-tree
Liriodendron tulipifera," In their internal structure, however, they are quite different"
Liriodendron tulipifera," Instead of the triple arrangements of stamens and pistil parts, they have indefinite numbers arranged in spirals"
Liriodendron tulipifera,"


== Distribution and habitat ==
One of the largest and most valuable hardwoods of eastern North America, it is native from Connecticut and southern New York, westward to southern Ontario and northern Ohio, and south to Louisiana and northern Florida"
Liriodendron tulipifera," It is found sparingly in New England, it is abundant on the southern shore of Lake Erie and westward to Illinois"
Liriodendron tulipifera," It extends south to north Florida, and is rare west of the Mississippi River, but is found occasionally for ornamentals"

Liriodendron tulipifera,"


== Ecology ==
Liriodendron tulipifera is generally considered to be a shade-intolerant species that is most commonly associated with the first century of forest succession"
Liriodendron tulipifera," In Appalachian forests, it is a dominant species during the 50–150 years of succession, but is absent or rare in stands of trees 500 years or older"
Liriodendron tulipifera," One particular group of trees survived in the grounds of Orlagh College, Dublin for 200 years, before having to be cut down in 1990"
Liriodendron tulipifera," On mesic, fertile soils, it often forms pure or nearly pure stands"
Liriodendron tulipifera, It can and does persist in older forests when there is sufficient disturbance to generate large enough gaps for regeneration
Liriodendron tulipifera, Individual trees have been known to live for up to around 500 years
Liriodendron tulipifera,"All young tulip trees and most mature specimens are intolerant of prolonged inundation; however, a coastal plain swamp ecotype in the southeastern United States is relatively flood-tolerant"
Liriodendron tulipifera," This ecotype is recognized by its blunt-lobed leaves, which may have a red tint"
Liriodendron tulipifera,"
Liriodendron tulipifera produces a large amount of seed, which is dispersed by wind"
Liriodendron tulipifera," The seeds typically travel a distance equal to 4–5 times the height of the tree, and remain viable for 4–7 years"
Liriodendron tulipifera," The seeds are not one of the most important food sources for wildlife, but they are eaten by a number of birds and mammals"
Liriodendron tulipifera,"Vines, especially wild grapevines, are known to be extremely damaging to young trees of this species"
Liriodendron tulipifera," Vines are damaging both due to blocking out solar radiation, and increasing weight on limbs which can lead to bending of the trunk and/or breaking of limbs"
Liriodendron tulipifera,"


=== Host plant ===
In terms of its role in the ecological community, L"
Liriodendron tulipifera," tulipifera does not host a great diversity of insects, with only 28 species of moths associated with the tree"

Liriodendron tulipifera,"


== East Central Florida ecotype ==
Parts of east-central Florida near Orlando have an ecotype with similar-looking leaves to the coastal plain variant of the Carolinas; it flowers much earlier (usually in March, although flowering can begin in late January), with a smaller yellower bloom than other types"
Liriodendron tulipifera," This east central Florida ecotype/Peninsular allozyme group seems to have the best ability to tolerate very wet conditions, where it may grow short pencil-like root structures (pneumatophores) similar to those produced by other swamp trees in warm climates"
Liriodendron tulipifera," Superior resistance to drought, pests and wind is also noted"
Liriodendron tulipifera, Some individuals retain their leaves all year unless a hard frost strikes
Liriodendron tulipifera, Places where it may be seen include Dr
Liriodendron tulipifera, Howard A
Liriodendron tulipifera," Kelly Park, Lake Eola Park, Spring Hammock Preserve, Big Tree Park home of The Senator (tree) and
the University of Central Florida Arboretum"
Liriodendron tulipifera,"


== Cultivation and use ==
Liriodendron tulipifera grows readily from seeds, which should be sown in a fine soft mould, and in a cool and shady situation"
Liriodendron tulipifera," If sown in autumn they come up the succeeding spring, but if sown in spring they often remain a year in the ground"
Liriodendron tulipifera, Loudon says that seeds from the highest branches of old trees are most likely to germinate
Liriodendron tulipifera, It is readily propagated from cuttings and easily transplanted
Liriodendron tulipifera,"


=== In landscaping ===
Tulip trees make magnificently shaped specimen trees, and are very large, growing to about 35 m (110 ft) in good soil"
Liriodendron tulipifera, They grow best in deep well-drained loam which has thick dark topsoil
Liriodendron tulipifera," They show stronger response to fertilizer compounds (those with low salt index are preferred) than most other trees, but soil structure and organic matter content are more important"
Liriodendron tulipifera, In the wild it is occasionally seen around serpentine outcrops
Liriodendron tulipifera, The southeastern coastal plain and east central Florida ecotypes occur in wet but not stagnant soils which are high in organic matter
Liriodendron tulipifera, All tulip trees are unreliable in clay flats which are subject to ponding and flooding
Liriodendron tulipifera," 
Like other members of the Magnolia family, they have fleshy roots that are easily broken if handled roughly"
Liriodendron tulipifera," Transplanting should be done in early spring, before leaf-out; this timing is especially important in the more northern areas"
Liriodendron tulipifera, Fall planting is often successful in Florida
Liriodendron tulipifera, The east central Florida ecotype may be more easily moved than other strains because its roots grow over nine or ten months every year—several months longer than other ecotypes
Liriodendron tulipifera," Most tulip trees have low tolerance of drought, although Florida natives (especially the east central ecotype) fare better than southeastern coastal plain or northern inland specimens"
Liriodendron tulipifera,"
It is recommended as a shade tree"
Liriodendron tulipifera, The tree's tall and rapid growth is a function of its shade intolerance
Liriodendron tulipifera," Grown in the full sun, the species tends to grow shorter, slower, and rounder, making it adaptable to landscape planting"
Liriodendron tulipifera," In forest settings, most investment is made in the trunk (i"
Liriodendron tulipifera,e
Liriodendron tulipifera,", the branches are weak and easily break off, a sign of axial dominance) and lower branches are lost early as new, higher branches closer to the sun continue the growth spurt upward"

Magnolia macrophylla,"Magnolia macrophylla, the bigleaf magnolia, is a deciduous magnolia native to the southeastern United States and eastern Mexico"
Magnolia macrophylla, This species boasts the largest simple leaf and single flower of any native plant in North America
Magnolia macrophylla,"


== Classification ==

Magnolia macrophylla has three subspecies; some botanists treat these plants as three separate species:

Magnolia macrophylla subsp"
Magnolia macrophylla, macrophylla
Magnolia macrophylla, Bigleaf magnolia
Magnolia macrophylla, Southeastern United States
Magnolia macrophylla, Secure
Magnolia macrophylla," Tree to 20 m; leaves 50–90 cm long, fruit 4–10 cm long with more than 50 carpels"
Magnolia macrophylla,"
Magnolia macrophylla subsp"
Magnolia macrophylla, ashei (Wetherby) Spongberg
Magnolia macrophylla, Ashe magnolia
Magnolia macrophylla, Northwest Florida
Magnolia macrophylla," Shrub or small tree to 12 m; leaves 25–60 cm long, fruit 4–5 cm long with less than 50 carpels"
Magnolia macrophylla,"  Considered by some botanists to be a distinct species, Magnolia ashei"

Magnolia macrophylla subsp"
Magnolia macrophylla, dealbata (Zuccarini) J
Magnolia macrophylla, D
Magnolia macrophylla, Tobe
Magnolia macrophylla, Mexican bigleaf magnolia or Cloudforest magnolia
Magnolia macrophylla," Mexico (Hidalgo to Oaxaca and Veracruz, in cloud forests)"
Magnolia macrophylla," Tree to 20 m; leaves 30–60 cm long, fruit 8–15 cm long with more than 70 carpels"
Magnolia macrophylla,"  Considered by some botanists to be a distinct species, Magnolia dealbata"
Magnolia macrophylla,"


== Description ==
Bigleaf magnolia is medium-sized understory tree 15–20 m tall, though some individuals over 27m tall (and over 100 cm circumference)  have been documented by the Eastern Native Tree Society"
Magnolia macrophylla,"  This species is distinguished from other magnolias by the large leaf size, 25–80 cm long and 11–30 cm broad"
Magnolia macrophylla, The tree's branches often bend under the weight of this heavy foliage
Magnolia macrophylla,"

		
		
		


== Distribution and habitat ==
Bigleaf magnolia is found in rich mesic woods; any disturbance that lets more light reach the ground is beneficial to the establishment of bigleaf magnolia, but despite its relatively fast growth-rate when stimulated by more light, other understory and canopy trees/seedlings are usually able to outgrow and out-compete it"
Magnolia macrophylla," This suits the plant just fine as it is tolerant of low light levels; it does not need full sun to survive once established (however, it does not tolerate full shade)"
Magnolia macrophylla," Natural regeneration is quite limited due to the scarcity of mature, seed-bearing plants and the fact that this tree's population mostly consists of widely scattered individuals"
Magnolia macrophylla," In addition, this species is plagued by poor seed set (most likely from limiting factors mentioned above) and low seed viability, a trait shared by its cousin and frequent associate in the wild in Appalachia, the Fraser magnolia"
Magnolia macrophylla,"
The Ashe magnolia is a rare shrub, exceptionally a small tree, that is found only along the bluffs and ravines adjacent to the Apalachicola River in Florida, along with several other rare plants unique to the area, such as Florida Yew and Florida torreya"
Magnolia macrophylla, It resembles the typical subsp
Magnolia macrophylla," macrophylla, but has shorter, broader leaves, smaller flowers, and longer fruits"
Magnolia macrophylla," The 6-to-8-inch-diameter (150 to 200 mm) flowers bloom in late spring, and are white with rose-purple blotches on the inner tepals"
Magnolia macrophylla," The fruit is eaten by wildlife, but because of the plant's scarceness, it does not form a significant portion of any creature's diet"
Magnolia macrophylla,"
In the southeastern United States, especially Alabama and surrounding areas, Magnolia macrophylla is sometimes called the ""cowcumber magnolia,"" in contrast with the much smaller-leaved cucumber-tree magnolia, M"
Magnolia macrophylla, acuminata
Magnolia macrophylla,"


== Threats ==
Collection, both legal and illegal, may have an adverse impact on this tree's population due to low population density, and high collection pressure can extirpate this species locally"
Magnolia macrophylla,  Bigleaf magnolia is listed as threatened in North Carolina and endangered in Arkansas and Ohio
Magnolia macrophylla,"  The Florida Department of Agriculture lists the Ashe magnolia as endangered, due to its small population and restricted range"
Magnolia macrophylla,"


== Cultivation ==
Bigleaf magnolia is often short-lived under cultivation unless its rather demanding requirements are met"
Magnolia macrophylla," This tree likes loose, undisturbed rich mesic soil (or mulch and compost substitutes) in full sun or part shade with  moist, well-drained soil and a low pH"
Magnolia macrophylla, This tree will likely succeed in sites that closely mimic its natural habitat and where it is protected from strong wind that can tatter its large foliage
Magnolia macrophylla," It can be grown farther north than its southernly range suggests, but needs watering during extended dry periods"
Magnolia macrophylla, This plant is generally problem free

Malus pumila, Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists
Malus pumila," Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian tradition"
Malus pumila,"
Apple trees are large if grown from seed"
Malus pumila,"  Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by grafting onto rootstocks, which control the size of the resulting tree"
Malus pumila," There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics"
Malus pumila," Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including cooking, eating raw and cider production"
Malus pumila," Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means"
Malus pumila," In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production"
Malus pumila,"
Worldwide production of apples in 2017 was 83"
Malus pumila,"1 million tonnes, with China accounting for half of the total"
Malus pumila,"


== Etymology ==
The word ""apple"", formerly spelled æppel in Old English, is derived from the Proto-Germanic root *ap(a)laz, which could also mean fruit in general"
Malus pumila," This is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both words is uncertain"
Malus pumila,"
As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than berries but including nuts—such as the 14th century Middle English word appel of paradis, meaning a banana"
Malus pumila, This use is analogous to the French language use of pomme
Malus pumila,"


== Description ==

The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 6 to 15 ft (1"
Malus pumila,8 to 4
Malus pumila,6 m) tall in cultivation and up to 30 ft (9
Malus pumila,1 m) in the wild
Malus pumila," When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method"
Malus pumila, The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides
Malus pumila,"

Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some long shoots"
Malus pumila, The 3 to 4 cm (1
Malus pumila,2 to 1
Malus pumila,"6 in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers"
Malus pumila," The central flower of the inflorescence is called the ""king bloom""; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit"
Malus pumila,"The fruit matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes"
Malus pumila, Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 2 3⁄4 to 3 1⁄4 in (7
Malus pumila,0 to 8
Malus pumila,"3 cm) in diameter, due to market preference"
Malus pumila," Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 2 1⁄4 in (5"
Malus pumila,7 cm) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value
Malus pumila," The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found"

Malus pumila," The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white, though pink or yellow exocarps also occur"
Malus pumila,"


=== Wild ancestors ===

The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii, found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China"
Malus pumila," Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds"
Malus pumila," Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii"
Malus pumila, In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates
Malus pumila,"


=== Genome ===
In 2010, an Italian-led consortium announced they had sequenced the complete genome of the apple in collaboration with horticultural genomicists at Washington State University, using 'Golden Delicious'"
Malus pumila," It had about 57,000 genes, the highest number of any plant genome studied to date and more genes than the human genome (about 30,000)"
Malus pumila," This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists identify genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics"
Malus pumila, Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will help scientists perform more knowledgeable selective breeding
Malus pumila, The genome sequence also provided proof that Malus sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community
Malus pumila,"


== History ==

Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor species to the cultivated apple, and is morphologically similar"
Malus pumila," Due to the genetic variability in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, this region is generally considered the center of origin for apples"
Malus pumila,Humans have been eating apples for thousands of years
Malus pumila," At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have been found in material carbon dated to around 4000 BCE"
Malus pumila, Genetic analysis has not yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient apples were wild Malus Sylvestris or Malus Domesticus containing Malus sieversii ancestry
Malus pumila, It is generally also hard to distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple plantations
Malus pumila,"
There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation in the third millenium BCE in the Middle East"
Malus pumila," There was substantial apple production  in the European classical antiquity, and grafting was certainly known then"
Malus pumila," Grafting is an essential part of modern domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate the best cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented"
Malus pumila,"Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia"
Malus pumila,"
Of the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th century, apple trees became particularly well adapted"
Malus pumila," Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in the 17th century, and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1625"
Malus pumila," The only apples native to North America are crab apples, which were once called ""common apples"""
Malus pumila," Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms"
Malus pumila," An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the ""best"" cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th century"
Malus pumila," In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product"
Malus pumila,"Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for sale"
Malus pumila, Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage
Malus pumila, Controlled atmosphere facilities are used to keep apples fresh year-round
Malus pumila," Controlled atmosphere facilities use high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to maintain fruit freshness"
Malus pumila, They were first used in the United States in the 1960s

== Society and culture ==


=== Germanic paganism ===

In Norse mythology, the goddess Iðunn is portrayed in the Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness"
Malus pumila, English scholar H
Malus pumila, R
Malus pumila," Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed"
Malus pumila," She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England"
Malus pumila,"Davidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a tribe of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven ""golden apples"" being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by Skírnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of Skírnismál"
Malus pumila," Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the Völsunga saga when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound"
Malus pumila, Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the Caesarean section birth of their son—the hero Völsung
Malus pumila,"Further, Davidson points out the ""strange"" phrase ""Apples of Hel"" used in an 11th-century poem by the skald Thorbiorn Brúnarson"
Malus pumila, She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead
Malus pumila," Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories"
Malus pumila," Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter"
Malus pumila," Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn ""we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world"
Malus pumila,"""


=== Greek mythology ===

Apples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit"
Malus pumila," One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that the word ""apple"" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century"
Malus pumila," For instance, in Greek mythology, the Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center"
Malus pumila,"The Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis"
Malus pumila," In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed Καλλίστη (Kalliste, sometimes transliterated Kallisti, ""For the most beautiful one""), into the wedding party"
Malus pumila," Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite"
Malus pumila, Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient
Malus pumila," After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta"
Malus pumila," He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War"
Malus pumila,"The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite"
Malus pumila," To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love"
Malus pumila," An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:
I throw the apple at you, and if you are willing to love me, take it and share your girlhood with me; but if your thoughts are what I pray they are not, even then take it, and consider how short-lived is beauty"
Malus pumila,"

Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage"
Malus pumila," She outran all but Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from melon the Greek word for both ""apple"" and fruit in general), who defeated her by cunning, not speed"
Malus pumila," Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta"
Malus pumila," It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand"
Malus pumila,"


=== Christian art ===

Though the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her"
Malus pumila," The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in confusion between the Latin words mālum (an apple) and mălum (an evil), each of which is normally written malum"
Malus pumila," The tree of the forbidden fruit is called ""the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"" in Genesis 2:17, and the Latin for ""good and evil"" is bonum et malum"
Malus pumila,Renaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides
Malus pumila," As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself"
Malus pumila," The larynx in the human throat has been called the ""Adam's apple"" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam"
Malus pumila," The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein"
Malus pumila,"


=== Proverb ===
The proverb, ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away"", addressing the supposed health benefits of the fruit, has been traced to 19th-century Wales, where the original phrase was ""Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread"""
Malus pumila," In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to ""an apple a day, no doctor to pay"" and ""an apple a day sends the doctor away""; the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922"
Malus pumila," Despite the proverb, there is no evidence that eating an apple daily has a significant health effect"
Malus pumila,"


== Cultivars ==

There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples"
Malus pumila," Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock"
Malus pumila, Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates
Malus pumila," The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent"
Malus pumila," The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection"
Malus pumila, The University of Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group
Malus pumila,"The UK's national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same ""genetic"" apple cultivar"
Malus pumila," Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider"
Malus pumila," Cider apples are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot"
Malus pumila,Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp
Malus pumila," Other desirable qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor"
Malus pumila," Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time"
Malus pumila," Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following"
Malus pumila," Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia, especially the Indian Subcontinent "
Malus pumila,"Old cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and grow in a variety of textures and colors"
Malus pumila," Some find them to have better flavor than modern cultivars, but they may have other problems that make them commercially unviable—low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or just being the ""wrong"" size"
Malus pumila," A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets"
Malus pumila, Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction
Malus pumila," In the United Kingdom, old cultivars such as 'Cox's Orange Pippin' and 'Egremont Russet' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease"

== Cultivation ==


=== Breeding ===

Many apples grow readily from seeds"
Malus pumila," However, more than with most perennial fruits, apples must be propagated asexually by grafting to obtain the sweetness and other desirable characteristics of the parent"
Malus pumila," This is because seedling apples are an example of ""extreme heterozygotes"", in that rather than inheriting genes from their parents to create a new apple with parental characteristics, they are instead significantly different from their parents, perhaps to compete with the many pests"
Malus pumila," Triploid cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that 3 sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids)"
Malus pumila," Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive"
Malus pumila,"Because apples do not breed true when planted as seeds, grafting is generally used to produce new apple trees"
Malus pumila," The rootstock used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree"
Malus pumila, Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees (less than 3
Malus pumila,"0 m (10 ft) high at maturity), which bear fruit earlier in their life cycle than full size trees"
Malus pumila," Dwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BC, to the area of Persia and Asia Minor"
Malus pumila, Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees to Aristotle's Lyceum
Malus pumila, Dwarf rootstocks became common by the 15th century and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world
Malus pumila, The majority of the rootstocks used today to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s
Malus pumila," The East Malling Research Station conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and today their rootstocks are given an ""M"" prefix to designate their origin"
Malus pumila," Rootstocks marked with an ""MM"" prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed with trees of 'Northern Spy' in Merton, England"
Malus pumila,"Most new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics"
Malus pumila," The words ""seedling"", ""pippin"", and ""kernel"" in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling"
Malus pumila, Apples can also form bud sports (mutations on a single branch)
Malus pumila, Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar
Malus pumila, Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars
Malus pumila,"Since the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the University of Minnesota has introduced a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin"
Malus pumila," Its most important contributions have included 'Haralson' (which is the most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), 'Wealthy', 'Honeygold', and 'Honeycrisp'"
Malus pumila,"
Apples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes, where they can often, with the needed factors, provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year-round"
Malus pumila,"


=== Pollination ===

Apples are self-incompatible; they must cross-pollinate to develop fruit"
Malus pumila," During the flowering each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen"
Malus pumila, Honey bees are most commonly used
Malus pumila, Orchard mason bees are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards
Malus pumila," Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in sufficient number to be significant pollinators"
Malus pumila,"There are four to seven pollination groups in apples, depending on climate:

Group A – Early flowering, 1 to 3 May in England ('Gravenstein', 'Red Astrachan')
Group B – 4 to 7 May ('Idared', 'McIntosh')
Group C – Mid-season flowering, 8 to 11 May ('Granny Smith', 'Cox's Orange Pippin')
Group D – Mid/late season flowering, 12 to 15 May ('Golden Delicious', 'Calville blanc d'hiver')
Group E – Late flowering, 16 to 18 May ('Braeburn', 'Reinette d'Orléans')
Group F – 19 to 23 May ('Suntan')
Group H – 24 to 28 May ('Court-Pendu Gris' – also called Court-Pendu plat)One cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close (A with A, or A with B, but not A with C or D)"
Malus pumila,"Cultivars are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average 30-day blossom period, with pollenizers selected from cultivars within a 6-day overlap period"
Malus pumila,"


=== Maturation and harvest ===

Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock"
Malus pumila," Some cultivars, if left unpruned, grow very large—letting them bear more fruit, but making harvesting more difficult"
Malus pumila," Depending on tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear 40–200 kg (90–440 lb) of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years"
Malus pumila, Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches
Malus pumila, Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks bear about 10–80 kg (20–180 lb) of fruit per year
Malus pumila,Farms with apple orchards open them to the public so consumers can pick their own apples
Malus pumila,Crops ripen at different times of the year according to the cultivar
Malus pumila," Cultivar that yield their crop in the summer include 'Gala', 'Golden Supreme', 'McIntosh', 'Transparent', 'Primate', 'Sweet Bough', and 'Duchess'; fall producers include 'Fuji', 'Jonagold', 'Golden Delicious', 'Red Delicious', 'Chenango', 'Gravenstein', 'Wealthy', 'McIntosh', 'Snow', and 'Blenheim'; winter producers include 'Winesap', 'Granny Smith', 'King', 'Wagener', 'Swayzie', 'Greening', and 'Tolman Sweet'"
Malus pumila,"


=== Storage ===

Commercially, apples can be stored for some months in controlled atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening"
Malus pumila, Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and high air filtration
Malus pumila, This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly
Malus pumila,"
For home storage, most cultivars of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (i"
Malus pumila,e
Malus pumila, below 5 °C)
Malus pumila, Some can be stored up to a year without significant degradation
Malus pumila, Some varieties of apples (e
Malus pumila,g
Malus pumila, 'Granny Smith' and 'Fuji') have more than three times the storage life of others
Malus pumila,"Non-organic apples may be sprayed with 1-methylcyclopropene blocking the apples' ethylene receptors, temporarily preventing them from ripening"
Malus pumila,"


=== Pests and diseases ===

Apple trees are susceptible to a number of fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests"
Malus pumila," Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields"
Malus pumila," These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed"
Malus pumila," Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest"
Malus pumila,"
A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant"
Malus pumila," Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew, aphids, and apple scab"
Malus pumila,"

Mildew is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring"
Malus pumila, The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly
Malus pumila, This can be treated similarly to Botrytis—eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions
Malus pumila,"
Aphids are a small insect"
Malus pumila," Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid"
Malus pumila," The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear)"
Malus pumila, Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices
Malus pumila," When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor"
Malus pumila,"
Apple scab: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture"
Malus pumila," The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures"
Malus pumila, Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth
Malus pumila,"Among the most serious disease problems are a bacterial disease called fireblight, and two fungal diseases: Gymnosporangium rust and black spot"
Malus pumila, Other pests that affect apple trees include Codling moths and apple maggots
Malus pumila," Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter"
Malus pumila," The larvae of the apple clearwing moth (red-belted clearwing) burrow through the bark and into the phloem of apple trees, potentially causing significant damage"
Malus pumila,"


== Production ==

World production of apples in 2017 was 83"
Malus pumila,"1 million tonnes, with China producing 50% and Europe including Turkey producing 17% of the total (table)"
Malus pumila," Other significant producers each with 3–5% of the world total were the United States, Turkey, and Poland"
Malus pumila,"


== Nutrition ==
A raw apple is 86% water and 14% carbohydrates, with negligible content of fat and protein (table)"
Malus pumila, A reference serving of a raw apple with skin weighing 100 grams provides 52 calories and a moderate content of dietary fiber
Malus pumila," Otherwise, there is low content of all micronutrients (table)"
Malus pumila,"


== Human consumption ==

All parts of the fruit, including the skin, except for the seeds, are suitable for human consumption"
Malus pumila," The core, from stem to bottom, containing the seeds, is usually not eaten and is discarded"
Malus pumila,"
Apples can be consumed various ways: juice, raw in salads, baked in pies, cooked into sauces and spreads like apple butter, and other baked dishes"
Malus pumila,Several techniques are used to preserve apples and apple products
Malus pumila," Apples can be canned, dried or frozen"
Malus pumila, Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes
Malus pumila, Apple juice or cider is also bottled
Malus pumila, Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen
Malus pumila,"


=== Popular uses ===
Apples are often eaten raw"
Malus pumila, Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples
Malus pumila,"

In the UK, a toffee apple is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot toffee and allowing it to cool"
Malus pumila, Similar treats in the U
Malus pumila,S
Malus pumila, are candy apples (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup) and caramel apples (coated with cooled caramel)
Malus pumila,"
Apples are eaten with honey at the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah to symbolize a sweet new year"
Malus pumila,"Apples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake"
Malus pumila," When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce"
Malus pumila, Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly
Malus pumila, They are often baked or stewed and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes
Malus pumila," Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid)"
Malus pumila,"
Apples are milled or pressed to produce apple juice, which may be drunk unfiltered (called apple cider in North America), or filtered"
Malus pumila," Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed"
Malus pumila," Apple juice can be fermented to make cider (called hard cider in North America), ciderkin, and vinegar"
Malus pumila," Through distillation, various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as applejack, Calvados, and apfelwein"
Malus pumila,"


=== Organic production ===
Organic apples are commonly produced in the United States"
Malus pumila," Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe"
Malus pumila," The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has been approved by the EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality"
Malus pumila," A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding"
Malus pumila,"


=== Phytochemicals ===
Apple skins and seeds contain various phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols which are under preliminary research for their potential health effects"
Malus pumila,"


=== Non-browning apples ===
The enzyme, polyphenol oxidase, causes browning in sliced or bruised apples, by catalyzing the oxidation of phenolic compounds to o-quinones, a browning factor"
Malus pumila," Browning reduces apple taste, color, and food value"
Malus pumila," Arctic Apples, a non-browning group of apples introduced to the United States market in 2019, have been genetically modified to silence the expression of polyphenol oxidase, thereby delaying a browning effect and improving apple eating quality"
Malus pumila," The US Food and Drug Administration in 2015, and Canadian Food Inspection Agency in 2017, determined that Arctic apples are as safe and nutritious as conventional apples"
Malus pumila,"


=== Other products ===
Apple seed oil is obtained by pressing apple seeds for manufacturing cosmetics"
Malus pumila,"


=== Research ===
Preliminary research is investigating whether apple consumption may affect the risk of some types of cancer"
Malus pumila,"


=== Allergy ===
One form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen"
Malus pumila," Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables"
Malus pumila," Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis"
Malus pumila, This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process
Malus pumila," The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits"
Malus pumila, Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome
Malus pumila,"In other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches"
Malus pumila," This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening"
Malus pumila, Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts
Malus pumila," Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals cannot eat raw or cooked apples"
Malus pumila," Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction"
Malus pumila,Breeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy
Malus pumila,"


=== Toxicity of seeds ===
Apple seeds contain small amounts of amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide compound known as a cyanogenic glycoside"
Malus pumila," Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds causes no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions"
Malus pumila," It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released"
Malus pumila, The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds

Ostrya virginiana,"Ostrya virginiana, the American hophornbeam, is a species of Ostrya native to eastern North America, from Nova Scotia west to southern Manitoba and eastern Wyoming, southeast to northern Florida and southwest to eastern Texas"
Ostrya virginiana," Populations from Mexico and Central America are also regarded as the same species, although some authors prefer to separate them as a distinct species, Ostrya guatemalensis"
Ostrya virginiana,"  Other names include eastern hophornbeam, hardhack (in New England), ironwood, and leverwood"
Ostrya virginiana,"


== Description ==
American hophornbeam is a small deciduous understory tree growing to 18 m (59 ft) tall and 20–50 centimetres (8–20 in) trunk diameter"
Ostrya virginiana," The bark is brown to gray-brown, with narrow shaggy plates flaking off, while younger twigs and branches are smoother and gray, with small lenticels"
Ostrya virginiana, Very young twigs are sparsely fuzzy to thickly hairy; the hairs (trichomes) drop off by the next year
Ostrya virginiana,"The leaves are ovoid-acute, 5–13 cm (2–5 in) long and 4–6 cm (1 1⁄2–2 1⁄4 in) broad, pinnately veined, with a doubly serrated margin"
Ostrya virginiana," The upper surface is mostly hairless, while the lower surface is sparsely to moderately fuzzy (rarely densely hairy)"
Ostrya virginiana,The flowers are catkins (spikes) produced in early spring at the same time as the new leaves appear
Ostrya virginiana," The staminate (male) catkins are 2–5 cm (3⁄4–2 in) long, and arranged in groups of 1–4"
Ostrya virginiana," The pistillate (female) catkins are 8–15 mm (5⁄16–19⁄32 in) long, containing 10–30 flowers each"
Ostrya virginiana,Pollinated female flowers develop into small nutlets 3–5 mm (1⁄8–3⁄16 in) long fully enclosed in a papery sac-shaped involucre 10–18 mm (3⁄8–11⁄16 in) long and 8–10 mm (5⁄16–3⁄8 in) wide
Ostrya virginiana, The involucre changes from greenish-white to dull brown as the fruit matures
Ostrya virginiana,"American hophornbeam is similar to its close relative American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), which can be distinguished by its smooth bark and nutlets enclosed in open, three-lobed bracts"
Ostrya virginiana,"

== Distribution ==
Scots pine is the only pine native to northern Europe, forming either pure forests or mixed with Norway spruce, common juniper, silver birch, European rowan, Eurasian aspen and other hardwood species"
Pinus sylvestris," In central and southern Europe, it occurs with numerous additional species, including European black pine, mountain pine, Macedonian pine, and Swiss pine"
Pinus sylvestris," In the eastern part of its range, it occurs with Siberian pine, among others"
Pinus sylvestris,"


=== British Isles ===

The tree spread across the British Isles after the Last Glacial Maximum"
Pinus sylvestris," Pollen records show that pine was present locally in southern England by 9,000 years ago having entered from northeast France and that it had spread as far north as the Lake District and North Pennines 500 years later"
Pinus sylvestris,"
It was present in Ireland over 8,800 years ago but absent from Wales at that time which suggests that Scots pine in Ireland had a separate Iberian origin"
Pinus sylvestris," Pine expanded into Scotland between 8,000 and 8,500 years ago either from an independent refuge, from Scandinavia (via Doggerland) or from Ireland"
Pinus sylvestris," As the climate warmed it became extinct from most of the British Isles around 5,500 years ago except in Scotland and at Kielder, England"
Pinus sylvestris,"
The Irish and western Scottish populations went through a massive decline around 4,000 years ago which ultimately led to the extinction of the Irish population between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago"
Pinus sylvestris," It was replaced by large areas of blanket bog in western Scotland and Ireland though the reasons for its decline and extinction in England are not clear, but it may have been influenced by human activities"
Pinus sylvestris,In Britain it now occurs naturally only in Scotland
Pinus sylvestris," Historical and archaeological records indicate that it also occurred in Wales and England until about 300–400 years ago, becoming extinct there due to over-exploitation and grazing; it has been re-introduced in these countries"
Pinus sylvestris," Similar historical extinction and re-introduction applies to Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands"
Pinus sylvestris, Whether it truly became extinct in England is unknown
Pinus sylvestris, It has been speculated that it may have survived wild long enough for trees used in cultivation in England to derive from native (rather than imported) sources
Pinus sylvestris," Shakespeare (in Richard II) was familiar with the species in the 1590s, as was Evelyn in the early 1660s (Sylva), both around the time when Scots pine was thought to become extinct in England, but when landowners were also beginning ornamental and forestry planting"
Pinus sylvestris,"The Scots pine formed much of the Caledonian Forest, which once covered much of the Scottish Highland"
Pinus sylvestris," Overcutting for timber demand, fire, overgrazing by sheep and deer, and even deliberate clearance to deter wolves have all been factors in the decline of this once great pine and birch forest"
Pinus sylvestris," Only comparatively small areas (17,000 ha (42,000 acres), only just over 1% of the estimated original 1,500,000 ha (3,700,000 acres)) of this ancient forest remain, the main surviving remnants being at Abernethy Forest, Glen Affric, Rothiemurchus Forest, and the Black Wood of Rannoch"
Pinus sylvestris, Plans are currently in progress to restore at least some areas and work has started at key sites
Pinus sylvestris,"Additionally, the Scots pine is the plant badge of Clan Gregor and has been proposed as the national tree of Scotland"
Pinus sylvestris,"


== Cultivation and uses ==

Scots pine is an important tree in forestry"
Pinus sylvestris, The wood is used for pulp and sawn timber products
Pinus sylvestris," A seedling stand can be created by planting, sowing, or natural regeneration"
Pinus sylvestris," Commercial plantation rotations vary between 50 and 120 years, with longer rotations in northeastern areas where growth is slower"
Pinus sylvestris,"
In Scandinavian countries, Scots pine was used for making tar in the preindustrial age"
Pinus sylvestris," Some active tar producers still exist, but mostly the industry has ceased"
Pinus sylvestris, The pine has also been used as a source of rosin and turpentine
Pinus sylvestris,"
The wood is pale brown to red-brown, and used for general construction work"
Pinus sylvestris," It has a dry density around 470 kg/m3 (varying with growth conditions), an open porosity of 60%, a fibre saturation point of 0"
Pinus sylvestris,"25 kg/kg, and a saturation moisture content of 1"
Pinus sylvestris,60 kg/kg
Pinus sylvestris," Scots pine fibres are used to make the textile known as vegetable flannel, which has a hemp-like appearance, but with a tighter, softer texture"
Pinus sylvestris,"Scots pine has also been widely planted in New Zealand and much of the colder regions of North America; it was one of the first trees introduced to North America, in about 1600"
Pinus sylvestris," It is listed as an invasive species in some areas there, including Ontario, Michigan and Wisconsin"
Pinus sylvestris," It has been widely used in the United States for the Christmas tree trade, and was one of the most popular Christmas trees from the 1950s through the 1980s"
Pinus sylvestris," It remains popular for that usage, though it has been eclipsed in popularity, by such species as Fraser fir, Douglas-fir, and others"
Pinus sylvestris," Despite its invasiveness in parts of eastern North America, Scots pine does not often grow well there, partly due to climate and soil differences between its native habitat and that of North America, and partly due to damage by pests and diseases; the tree often grows in a twisted, haphazard manner if not tended to (as they are in the Christmas tree trade)"
Pinus sylvestris," Scots pines may be killed by the pine wood nematode, which causes pine wilt disease"
Pinus sylvestris, The nematode most often attacks trees that are at least ten years old and often kills trees it infects within a few weeks
Pinus sylvestris,"Several cultivars are grown for ornamental purposes in parks and large gardens, of which 'Aurea', 'Beuvronensis', 'Frensham', and 'Gold Coin' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit"
Pinus sylvestris,"The Scots pine was grown and used extensively in the coal mining regions of Flanders, Belgium"
Pinus sylvestris, It was used to fortify the tunnelling and preferred for its cracking sound when in need of replacing
Pinus sylvestris, Large patches of forest containing mostly this species are still scattered over the countryside

Pinus taeda," In the southern United States, the word is used to mean ""a mudhole; a mire,"" a sense derived from an allusion to the consistency of porridge"
Pinus taeda," Hence, the pine is named as it is generally found in lowlands and swampy areas"
Pinus taeda," Loblolly pines grow well in acidic, clay soil, which is common throughout the South, thus are often found in large stands in rural places"
Pinus taeda," Other old names, now rarely used, include oldfield pine, due to its status as an early colonizer of abandoned fields; bull pine, due to its size (several other yellow pines are also often so named, especially large isolated specimens); rosemary pine, due to loblolly's distinctive fragrance compared to the other southern pines; and North Carolina pine"
Pinus taeda,"For the scientific name, Pinus  is the Latin name for the pines and taeda  refers to the resinous wood"
Pinus taeda,"


== Ecology ==

Populus grandidentata,"Populus grandidentata, commonly called large-tooth aspen, big-tooth aspen, American aspen, Canadian poplar, or white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America"
Populus grandidentata,"


== Name ==
The name Populus is from the Latin for poplar, and  grandidentata refers to the coarse teeth on the leaves (grandis meaning ""large"", and dentata meaning ""toothed"")"
Populus grandidentata,"


== Description ==
Populus grandidentata is a medium-sized deciduous tree native to North America, found mostly in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada"
Populus grandidentata," Leaves are similar to Populus tremuloides, but slightly larger and having larger teeth"
Populus grandidentata,  The leaves tremble in the wind as P
Populus grandidentata, tremuloides does
Populus grandidentata,"  Bark of younger trees is olive-green, thin and smooth; after 30–40 years, the bark is gray, thick and rough with grooves"
Populus grandidentata,"


== Reproduction ==
Bigtooth aspens produce seeds from wind-pollinated flower clusters, known as catkins"
Populus grandidentata," The tree is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are on separate trees, which flower from mid-April to mid-May depending on the climate zone"
Populus grandidentata," The seed, a two-valved capsule, is distributed widely by the wind"
Populus grandidentata, Seed production begins around 10 years old
Populus grandidentata," Individuals can also reproduce through the roots after a disturbance event, such as fire or harvest; the roots of the dead/cut tree will begin to send up suckers, creating identical individuals, and can result in a stand of clones that resemble that individual"
Populus grandidentata," Seeds viability is high (around 80%) but despite this and the sheer number of seeds produced (a mature tree can produce over 1 million per season), very few actually end up germinating due to their short viability (two weeks), natural growth inhibitor, and high likelihood of landing in spots unsuitable for germination, which must be done on the surface of moist soil"
Populus grandidentata,"


== Growth ==
Bigtooth aspens are dioecious, medium-sized deciduous trees with straight trunks and gently ascending branches"
Populus grandidentata, Heights at maturity are around 60–80 feet (18–24 m) with diameters of 8–10 inches (20–25 cm)
Populus grandidentata," They are fast growing and are relatively short-lived; stands will begin to deteriorate after 60–70 years, while individuals can live up to 100 years"
Populus grandidentata, They often constitute early successional species of their landscapes
Populus grandidentata,  Roots are shallow and wide spreading; lateral root growth in a forest may be as far as 60 feet (18 m)
Populus grandidentata," Generally, four to five lateral roots originate from the tree, and then branch within 2 feet (60 cm); vertical, penetrating roots near the base anchor the tree"
Populus grandidentata,"


== Distribution ==
The range of Populus grandidentata extends from Virginia north to Maine and Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; west to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota; south through Iowa to extreme northeastern Missouri; and east through Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia"
Populus grandidentata,"  Disjunct populations are found in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina"
Populus grandidentata,"


== Ecology ==
The species is able to adapt to a wide range of soils, though it is most abundant on sands, loamy sands and light sandy loams"
Populus grandidentata,"  Big-tooth aspens can tolerate sandy uplands and high, rocky sites"
Populus grandidentata, The depth to the water table is generally about 5 feet (1
Populus grandidentata,5 m)
Populus grandidentata, Soil must be moist but well-aerated for good growth
Populus grandidentata," Being very shade intolerant, most shaded stems die"
Populus grandidentata," They are pioneer species on disturbed sites, persisting in successional communities until senescence"
Populus grandidentata, Rapid height growth of suckers allows it to outcompete other sprouting species such as red oak (Quercus rubra) and red maple (Acer rubrum) on many sites
Populus grandidentata," In the absence of disturbance, it is soon replaced by conifers and hardwoods"
Populus grandidentata," In the Great Lakes Region at the turn of the 20th century, many mature pine forests were logged and burned"
Populus grandidentata, Bigtooth and quaking aspens frequently dominated the postdisturbance forests
Populus grandidentata," Without fire or other disturbance, these forests are being replaced by later successional, shade-tolerant species"
Populus grandidentata," This aspen usually grows in even-aged, mixed stands, most commonly with quaking aspens"
Populus grandidentata," Codominant in both hardwood and conifer forests, it does not occur as a subdominant because of its extreme shade intolerance"
Populus grandidentata," Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is the predominant species in aspen stands in the Great Lakes region, but bigtooth aspen dominates on drier, upland sites"
Populus grandidentata, Aspen stands dominated by bigtooth aspens are generally more open than those dominated by quaking aspens
Populus grandidentata, It is more disease resistant than P
Populus grandidentata, tremuloides
Populus grandidentata, The most serious disease is hypoxylon canker (caused by Entoleuca mammata)
Populus grandidentata," Other rots, fungi, and root decay affect this species"
Populus grandidentata," A preferred host of gypsy moth, death occurs when nearly complete defoliation by gypsy moths is followed by a fungal infection by Armillaria spp"
Populus grandidentata, The ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus saxesceni) attacks fire-damaged bigtooth aspens
Populus grandidentata," Commonly, it occurs in areas that frequently burn, such as large upland areas distant from water and upwind of natural fire breaks, such as lakes"
Populus grandidentata,"


== Uses ==
Various wildlife feed on the bark, foliage, and twig buds"
Populus grandidentata,"The wood weighs 27 pounds (12 kg) per foot and is light-colored, straight-grained, fine-textured, and soft"
Populus grandidentata," It is used primarily for pulp, but can be used to make particle board and structural panels"
Populus grandidentata," Minor uses include log homes, pallets, boxes, match splints, chopsticks, hockey stick components, and ladders"

Populus tremuloides,"Populus tremuloides is a deciduous tree native to cooler areas of North America, one of several species referred to by the common name aspen"
Populus tremuloides," It is commonly called quaking aspen, trembling aspen, American aspen, mountain or golden aspen, trembling poplar, white poplar, popple, as well as others"
Populus tremuloides," The trees have tall trunks, up to 25 meters (82 feet) tall, with smooth pale bark, scarred with black"
Populus tremuloides," The glossy green leaves, dull beneath, become golden to yellow, rarely red, in autumn"
Populus tremuloides, The species often propagates through its roots to form large clonal groves originating from a shared root system
Populus tremuloides," These roots are not rhizomes, as new growth develops from adventitious buds on the parent root system (the ortet)"
Populus tremuloides,"
Populus tremuloides is the most widely distributed tree in North America, being found from Canada to central Mexico"
Populus tremuloides, It is the defining species of the aspen parkland biome in the Prairie Provinces of Canada and extreme northwest Minnesota
Populus tremuloides,"
The Quaking Aspen is the state tree of Utah"
Populus tremuloides,"


== Name ==
The quaking or trembling of the leaves that is referred to in the common names is due to the flexible flattened petioles"
Populus tremuloides," The specific epithet, tremuloides, evokes this trembling behavior and can be literally translated as ""like (Populus) tremula"", the European trembling aspen"
Populus tremuloides,"


== Description ==

Quaking aspen is a tall, fast growing tree, usually 20–25 m (65–80 ft) at maturity, with a trunk 20 to 80 cm (8 inches to 2 feet 7 inches) in diameter; records are 36"
Populus tremuloides,5 m (119 ft 9 in) in height and 1
Populus tremuloides,37 m (4 ft 6 in) in diameter
Populus tremuloides,"
The bark is relatively smooth, colored greenish-white to gray, and is marked by thick black horizontal scars and prominent black knots"
Populus tremuloides," Parallel vertical scars are tell-tale signs of elk, which strip off aspen bark with their front teeth"
Populus tremuloides,"
The leaves on mature trees are nearly round, 4–8 centimeters (1 1⁄2–3 1⁄4 inches) in diameter with small rounded teeth, and a 3–7-centimeter (1 1⁄4–2 3⁄4-inch) long, flattened petiole"
Populus tremuloides," Young trees and root sprouts have much larger (10–20 centimeters, 4–8 in long) nearly triangular leaves"
Populus tremuloides,"
Some species of Populus have petioles flattened partially along their length, while the aspens and some other poplars have them flattened from side to side along the entire length of the petiole"
Populus tremuloides,"
Aspens are dioecious, with separate male and female clones"
Populus tremuloides," The flowers are catkins 4–6 centimeters (1 1⁄2–2 1⁄4 in) long, produced in early spring before the leaves;  The fruit is a 10-centimeter-long (4-inch) pendulous string of 6-millimeter (1⁄4-inch) capsules, each capsule containing about ten minute seeds embedded in cottony fluff, which aids wind dispersal of the seeds when they are mature in early summer"
Populus tremuloides," Trees as young as 2-3 years old may begin seed production, but significant output begins starting at 10 years of age"
Populus tremuloides, Best seed production is obtained between the ages of 50-70 years
Populus tremuloides,"
Quaking aspen grows more slowly in the dry conditions of western North America than it does in the more humid east and also lives longer--ages of 100-120 years are typical in the west with some individuals living 200 years"
Populus tremuloides," In the east, stands decay faster, sometimes 60 years or less depending on the region"
Populus tremuloides,"


== Distribution ==
Quaking aspen occurs across Canada in all provinces and territories, with the possible exception of Nunavut"
Populus tremuloides," In the United States, it can be found as far north as the northern foothills of the Brooks Range in Alaska, where road margins and gravel pads provide islands of well-drained habitat in a region where soils are often waterlogged due to underlying permafrost"
Populus tremuloides, It occurs at low elevations as far south as northern Nebraska and central Indiana
Populus tremuloides," In the western United States, this tree rarely survives at elevations lower than 1,500 feet (460 m) due to hot summers experienced below that elevation, and is generally found at 5,000–12,000 feet (1,500–3,700 m)"
Populus tremuloides," It grows at high altitudes as far south as Guanajuato, Mexico"
Populus tremuloides,"
Quaking aspen grows in a wide variety of climatic conditions"
Populus tremuloides," January and July average temperatures range from −30 °C (−22 °F) and 16 °C (61 °F) in the Alaska Interior to −3 °C (27 °F) and 23 °C (73 °F) in Fort Wayne, Indiana"
Populus tremuloides," Average annual precipitation ranges from 1,020 mm (40 inches) in Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador to as little as 180 mm (7"
Populus tremuloides,1 inches) in the Alaska Interior
Populus tremuloides, The southern limit of the species' range roughly follows the 24 °C (75 °F) mean July isotherm
Populus tremuloides,"Shrub-like dwarf clones exist in marginal environments too cold and dry to be hospitable to full-size trees, for example at the species' upper elevation limits in the White Mountains"
Populus tremuloides,"


== Ecology ==

Quaking aspen propagates itself primarily through root sprouts, and extensive clonal colonies are common"
Populus tremuloides," Each colony is its own clone, and all trees in the clone have identical characteristics and share a single root structure"
Populus tremuloides, A clone may turn color earlier or later in the fall than its neighbouring aspen clones
Populus tremuloides," Fall colors are usually bright tones of yellow; in some areas, red blushes may be occasionally seen"
Populus tremuloides," As all trees in a given clonal colony are considered part of the same organism, one clonal colony, named Pando, is considered the heaviest and oldest living organism at six million kilograms and perhaps 80,000 years old"
Populus tremuloides," Aspens do produce seeds, but seldom grow from them"
Populus tremuloides," Pollination is inhibited by the fact that aspens are either male or female, and large stands are usually all clones of the same sex"
Populus tremuloides," Even if pollinated, the small seeds (three million per pound) are only viable a short time as they lack a stored food source or a protective coating"
Populus tremuloides,"The buds and bark supply food for snowshoe hares, moose, black bears, cottontail rabbits, porcupines, deer, grouse, and mountain beavers"
Populus tremuloides," The shoots are eaten by sheep, goats, and cattle"
Populus tremuloides, Elks are known to browse the trees
Populus tremuloides,"


=== Dieback ===
Beginning in 1996, individual North American scientists noticed an increase in dead or dying aspen trees"
Populus tremuloides," As this accelerated in 2004, word spread and a debate over causes began"
Populus tremuloides," No insect, disease, or environmental condition is yet specifically identified as a joint cause"
Populus tremuloides, Trees adjacent to one another are often stricken or not
Populus tremuloides," In other instances, entire groves have died"
Populus tremuloides,"
Many areas of the Western US have experienced increased diebacks which are often attributed to ungulate grazing and wildfire suppression"
Populus tremuloides," At high altitudes where grasses can be rare, ungulates can browse young aspen sprouts and prevent those young trees from reaching maturity"
Populus tremuloides," As a result, some aspen groves close to cattle or other grazing animals, such as deer or elk, have very few young trees and can be invaded by conifers, which are not typically browsed"
Populus tremuloides, Another possible deterrent to aspen regeneration is widespread wildfire suppression
Populus tremuloides,"  Aspens are vigorous resprouters and even though the above-ground portion of the organism may die in a wild-fire, the roots, which are often protected from lethal temperatures during a fire, will sprout new trees soon after a fire"
Populus tremuloides,"  Disturbances such as fires seem to be a necessary ecological event in order for aspens to compete with conifers, which tend to replace aspens over long, disturbance-free intervals"
Populus tremuloides,  The current dieback in the American West may have roots in the strict fire suppression policy in the United States
Populus tremuloides," On the other hand, the widespread decimation of conifer forests by the mountain pine beetle may provide increased opportunities for aspen groves to proliferate under the right conditions"
Populus tremuloides,"Because of the vegetative regeneration method of reproduction used by the aspen, where an entire group of trees are essentially clones, there is a concern that something that hits one will eventually kill all of the trees, presuming they share the same vulnerability"
Populus tremuloides, A conference was held in Utah in September 2006 to share notes and consider investigative methodology
Populus tremuloides,"


== Uses ==
Grouse and quail eat the winter buds"
Populus tremuloides," Mammals such as beavers and rabbits eat the bark, foliage, and buds"
Populus tremuloides," Game animals, sheep, and goats browse the foliage"
Populus tremuloides,Aspen bark contains a substance that was extracted by indigenous North Americans and European settlers of the western U
Populus tremuloides,S
Populus tremuloides, as a quinine substitute
Populus tremuloides,"Like other poplars, aspens make poor fuel wood, as they dry slowly, rot quickly, and do not give off much heat"
Populus tremuloides, Yet they are still widely used in campgrounds because they are cheap and plentiful and not widely used in building lumber
Populus tremuloides," Pioneers in the North American west used them to create log cabins and dugouts, though they were not the preferred species"
Populus tremuloides,"
The leaves of the quaking aspen and other species in the genus Populus serve as food for caterpillars of various moths and butterflies"
Populus tremuloides,"
In Canada, quaking aspen wood is used mainly for pulp products such as books, newsprint, and fine printing paper"
Populus tremuloides, It is especially good for panel products such as oriented strand board and waferboard
Populus tremuloides," It is light in weight and is used for furniture, boxes and crates, core stock in plywood, and wall panels"

Prunus pensylvanica," Scattered growth of the pin cherry also occurs in the Rocky Mountains, south to Colorado as well as in the Black Hills of South Dakota"
Prunus pensylvanica,"


== Ecology ==
The pin cherry can regenerate by seed and sprout"
Prunus pensylvanica, Its flowers are bisexual and pollinated by insects
Prunus pensylvanica," Seeds are dispersed by birds, small mammals, and gravity"
Prunus pensylvanica," As part of its reproductive strategy, pin cherries seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years"
Prunus pensylvanica," Seeds accumulate over prolonged periods, and soil seed banks may be viable for 50–100 years"
Prunus pensylvanica," Asexual reproduction is achieved by sprouting, and often thickets of pin cherry plants form"
Prunus pensylvanica,"The pin cherry is rather short lived, having a lifespan of only 20 to 40 years following a rapid maturation"
Prunus pensylvanica," Its root system is shallow, with roots tending to grow laterally"
Prunus pensylvanica, It is an important food source for many animals
Prunus pensylvanica, Winter moose browse it in the Great Lake states and boreal forest region
Prunus pensylvanica,"Though they are documented to sprout following cutting, individual pin cherry thickets are often killed if exposed to fire"
Prunus pensylvanica," Nonetheless, they have adapted as a species by the establishment of their seed banks which are protected from the most severe heat by their soil cover and fed by the nutrients in the resultant ash residue"
Prunus pensylvanica," Following a fire or other disturbance, seeds which may be dormant for years will germinate rapidly, stimulated by the altered conditions after fire"
Prunus pensylvanica," Combined with the rapid initial growth of seedlings, these characteristics enable groupings of Pin cherry thickets to dominate many burned-over areas, particularly in the northern hardwood forest"

Quercus montana, The chinkapin oak also has much smaller acorns than the chestnut oak
Quercus montana, The chestnut oak is easily distinguished from the swamp white oak because that tree has whitened undersides on the leaves
Quercus montana," Another important distinction between the chestnut oak and the swamp chestnut oak is by the habitat; if it grows on a ridge, it is chestnut oak, and if it grows in wet bottomlands, it is probably the more massive swamp chestnut oak; however, this is not fully reliable"

== Ecology ==

Water oak serves the same ecological role as weeping willow and other wetland trees"
Quercus nigra," It is adapted to wet, swampy areas, such as along ponds and stream banks, but can also tolerate well-drained sites and even heavy, compacted soils"
Quercus nigra," It grows in sandy soils, red clays, and old fields to the borders of swamps, streams, to bottomlands"
Quercus nigra," Due to its ability to grow and reproduce quickly, the water oak is often the most abundant species in a stand of trees"
Quercus nigra, The tree is relatively short-lived compared to other oaks and may live only 60 to 80 years
Quercus nigra, It does not compete well and does not tolerate even light shade
Quercus nigra, Water oak is frequently used to restore bottomland hardwood forests on land that was previously cleared for agriculture or pine plantations
Quercus nigra, Minimum age for flowering and fruiting is 20 years and the tree produces heavy crops of acorns nearly every year
Quercus nigra," Water oak is not recommended as an ornamental due to being short-lived, disease-prone, and extremely messy"
Quercus nigra,"
Hybrids of water oak are known with southern red oak (Quercus falcata), bluejack oak (Quercus incana), turkey oak (Quercus laevis), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), willow oak (Quercus phellos), Shumard oak (Quercus shumardii), and black oak (Quercus velutina)"
Quercus nigra,"
Water oak acorns are an important food for white-tailed deer, eastern gray squirrel, raccoon, wild turkey, mallard, wood duck, and bobwhite quail"
Quercus nigra," In winter, deer will browse the buds and young twigs"
Quercus nigra,"


== Uses and history ==
Water oak has been used for timber and for fuel by people in the southern states since the 17th century"
Quercus nigra," The wood is generally sold as ""red oak"", mixed with the wood from other red oaks"

Quercus stellata,"Quercus stellata, the post oak or iron oak, is a North American species of oak in the white oak section"
Quercus stellata," It is a slow-growing oak that lives in dry, poor soils, and is resistant to rot, fire, and drought"
Quercus stellata," Interbreeding occurs among white oaks, thus many hybrid species combinations occur"
Quercus stellata,"


== Introduction ==
Q"
Quercus stellata," stellata is native to the eastern and central United States, and found along the east coast from Massachusetts to Florida, and as far inland as Nebraska"
Quercus stellata, It is identifiable by the rounded cross-like shape formed by the leaf lobes and hairy underside of the leaves
Quercus stellata,"


== Description ==

Post oak is a relatively small tree, typically 10–15 m (33–50 ft) tall and trunk 30–60 cm (1–2 ft) in diameter, though occasional specimens reach 30 m (100 ft) tall and 140 cm (56 in or 4"
Quercus stellata,7 ft) in diameter
Quercus stellata," The leaves have a very distinctive shape, with three perpendicular terminal lobes, shaped much like a Maltese cross"
Quercus stellata," They are leathery, and tomentose (densely short-hairy) beneath"
Quercus stellata, The branching pattern of this tree often gives it a rugged appearance
Quercus stellata, The acorns are 1
Quercus stellata,5–2 cm (0
Quercus stellata,6-0
Quercus stellata,"8 in) long, and are mature in their first summer"
Quercus stellata,"


== Taxonomy ==
The specific epithet stellata is Latin for ""star""; it is named this because the trichome hairs on the bottom of  the leaves are stellate or star-shaped"
Quercus stellata, Several variants of Q
Quercus stellata, stellata were named by American botanist Charles Sprague Sargent
Quercus stellata, The variety most recognised by the US Forest Service is Q
Quercus stellata, stellata var
Quercus stellata," paludosa Sarg (delta post oak)

=== Hybrids ===


=== Similarity to Quercus alba ===
Both Quercus stellata and Q"
Quercus stellata, alba are in a section of Quercus called the white oaks
Quercus stellata," In the white oak section, Q"
Quercus stellata, stellata is a sister taxon with Quercus alba
Quercus stellata, Q
Quercus stellata, stellata is sold and distributed as white oak
Quercus stellata, One identifiable difference between the two trees is that Q
Quercus stellata, stellata is 'hairy' on the underside of the leaf
Quercus stellata,"


== Distribution and habitat ==
Q"
Quercus stellata," stellata is found in Southeastern United States, in the coast states from Massachusetts, to Texas, and inland to Iowa"
Quercus stellata," Normally found at the edge of a forest, it typically grows in dry, sandy areas, deficient of nutrients"
Quercus stellata,"


== Uses ==
Because of its ability to grow in dry sites, attractive crown, and strong horizontal branches, it is used in urban forestry"
Quercus stellata," It is resistant to decay, so it is used for railroad ties, siding, planks, construction timbers, stair risers and treads, flooring, pulp, veneer, particle board, fuel, and its namesake fence posts"
Quercus stellata," It is used for wildlife food for deer, turkeys, squirrels, and other rodents, but because the nuts contain tannin, it is toxic to cattle"
Quercus stellata,"


== Fire ecology ==
Q"
Quercus stellata, stellata has the ability to survive fires by having thicker bark
Quercus stellata, It is useful for fire surveys where the tree rings are used to get a fire history of an area
Quercus stellata, A tree ring survey of 36 trees in Illinois provided a 226-year tree ring record that indicated that many Q

Quercus virginiana,"Quercus virginiana, also known as the Southern live oak, is an evergreen oak tree endemic to the Southeastern United States"
Quercus virginiana," Though many other species are loosely called live oak, the Southern live oak is particularly iconic of the Old South"
Quercus virginiana, Many very large and old specimens of live oak can be found today in the Deep South region of the United States
Quercus virginiana,"


== Taxonomy ==
A large number of common names are used for this tree, including ""Virginia live oak"", ""bay live oak"", ""scrub live oak"", ""plateau oak"", ""plateau live oak"", ""escarpment live oak"", and (in Spanish) ""roble"""
Quercus virginiana," It is also often just called ""live oak"" within its native area, but the full name ""southern live oak"" helps to distinguish it from other live oaks, a general term for any evergreen species of oak"
Quercus virginiana,"This profusion of common names partly reflects an ongoing controversy about the classification of various live oaks, in particular its near relatives among the white oaks (Quercus subgenus Quercus, section Quercus)"
Quercus virginiana, Some authors recognize as distinct species the forms others consider to be varieties of Quercus virginiana
Quercus virginiana," Notably, the following two taxa, treated as species in the Flora of North America, are treated as varieties of southern live oak by the United States Forest Service: the escarpment live oak, Quercus fusiformis (Q"
Quercus virginiana, virginiana var
Quercus virginiana," fusiformis) and
the sand live oak, Quercus geminata (Q"
Quercus virginiana, virginiana var
Quercus virginiana, geminata)

Quercus virginiana,"


== Range ==
Live oak can be found in the wild growing and reproducing on the lower coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico and lower East Coast of the United States"
Quercus virginiana," Its native range begins in Southeast Virginia, and then continues south in a narrow band through North Carolina along the coast to the interior South Carolina coast, where its range begins to expand farther inland"
Quercus virginiana,"  The range of live oak continues to expand inland as it moves south, growing across southern  Georgia and covering all of Florida south to the northernmost Florida Keys"
Quercus virginiana,"  Live oak grows along the Florida panhandle to Mobile Bay, then westward across the southernmost two tiers of counties in Mississippi"
Quercus virginiana,"  Live oak grows across the southern third of Louisiana, except for some barrier islands and scattered parts of the most southern parishes"
Quercus virginiana," Live oak's range continues into Texas and narrows to hug the coast until just past Port Lavaca, Texas"
Quercus virginiana," The species reaches its northwestern limit in the granite massifs and canyons in Southwestern Oklahoma, a rare remnant from the last glaciation"
Quercus virginiana,"
Along the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic United States, live oak is found in both single and mixed species forests, dotting the savannas, and as occasional clumps in the grasslands along the lower coastal plain"
Quercus virginiana," Live oak grows in soils ranging from heavy textures (clay loams), to sands with layers of organic materials or fine particles"
Quercus virginiana,"  Live oak can be found dominating some maritime forests, especially where fire periodicity and duration are limited"
Quercus virginiana,  Live oak is found on higher topographic sites as well as hammocks in marshes and swamps
Quercus virginiana," In general, southern live oak hugs the coastline and is rarely found more than 300 feet above sea level"
Quercus virginiana, Live oaks grow across a wide range of sites with many moisture regimes  –  ranging from dry to moist
Quercus virginiana," Live oak will survive well on both dry sites and in wet areas, effectively handling short duration flooding if water is moving and drainage is good"
Quercus virginiana,  Good soil drainage is a key resource component for sustained live oak growth
Quercus virginiana," Required precipitation range is 40-65 inches of water per year, preferably in spring and summer"
Quercus virginiana,"  Soil is usually acidic, ranging between pH of 5"
Quercus virginiana,5 and 6
Quercus virginiana,5
Quercus virginiana," A live oak on Tyler Avenue in Annapolis, Maryland is the northernmost known mature specimen, although a number of saplings can be found growing around nearby Towson"
Quercus virginiana,"


== Description ==
 

Although live oaks retain their leaves nearly year-round, they are not true evergreens"
Quercus virginiana, Live oaks drop their leaves immediately before new leaves emerge in the spring
Quercus virginiana," Occasionally, senescing leaves may turn yellow or contain brown spots in the winter, leading to the mistaken belief that the tree has oak wilt, whose symptoms typically occur in the summer"
Quercus virginiana, A live oak's defoliation may occur sooner in marginal climates or in dry or cold winters
Quercus virginiana,"The bark is dark, thick, and furrowed longitudinally"
Quercus virginiana,"  The leaves are stiff and leathery, with the tops shiny dark green and the bottoms pale gray and very tightly tomentose, simple and typically flattish with bony-opaque margins, with a length of "
Quercus virginiana,75 - 6 inches (2 – 15 cm) and a width of 
Quercus virginiana,"4 - 2 inches (1 – 5 cm), borne alternately"
Quercus virginiana,  The male flowers are green hanging catkins with lengths of 3 - 4 inches (7
Quercus virginiana,5 –10 cm)
Quercus virginiana,"  The acorns are small, "
Quercus virginiana,4 - 1 inch (1 - 2
Quercus virginiana,"5 cm), oblong in shape (ovoid or oblong-ellipsoid), shiny and tan-brown to nearly black, often black at the tips, and borne singly or in clusters"
Quercus virginiana,"

Depending on the growing conditions, live oaks vary from a shrub-size to large and spreading tree-size: typical open-grown trees reach 20 meters (65"
Quercus virginiana,"5 feet) in height, with a limb spread of nearly 27 meters (88"
Quercus virginiana,5 feet)
Quercus virginiana, Their lower limbs often sweep down towards the ground before curving up again
Quercus virginiana," They can grow at severe angles, and Native Americans used to bend saplings over so that they would grow at extreme angles, to serve as trail markers"
Quercus virginiana,"
The branches frequently support other plant species such as rounded clumps of ball moss (Tillandsia recurvata), thick drapings of Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), resurrection fern (Pleopeltis polypodioides), and parasitic mistletoe"
Quercus virginiana,"
The southern live oak has a deep tap-root that anchors it when young and eventually develops into an extensive and widespread root system"
Quercus virginiana,"  This, along with its low center of gravity and other factors, makes the southern live oak extremely resistant to strong sustained winds, such as those seen in hurricanes"
Quercus virginiana,"The southern live oak responds ""with vigorous growth to plentiful moisture on well-drained soil"
Quercus virginiana,""" They tend to survive fire, because often a fire will not reach their crowns"
Quercus virginiana," Even if a tree is burned, its crowns and roots usually survive the fire and sprout vigorously"
Quercus virginiana," Furthermore, live oak forests discourage entry of fire from adjacent communities because they provide dense cover that discourages the growth of a flammable understory"
Quercus virginiana," They can withstand occasional floods and hurricanes, and are resistant to salt spray and moderate soil salinity"
Quercus virginiana,"  Although they grow best in well-drained sandy soils and loams, they will also grow in clay"
Quercus virginiana,"


== Uses ==

Live oak wood is hard, heavy, and difficult to work with, but very strong"
Quercus virginiana,"  In the days of wooden ships, live oaks were the preferred source of the framework timbers of the ship, using the natural trunk and branch angles for their strength"
Quercus virginiana, The frame of USS Constitution was constructed from Southern live oak wood harvested from St
Quercus virginiana," Simons Island, Georgia, and the density of the wood grain allowed it to survive cannon fire, thus earning her the nickname ""Old Ironsides"""
Quercus virginiana,"  Even today, the U"
Quercus virginiana,S
Quercus virginiana, Navy continues to own extensive live oak tracts
Quercus virginiana,The primary uses for Southern live oaks today are providing food and shelter for wildlife
Quercus virginiana," Among the animals for which live oak acorns are an important food source are the bobwhite quail, the threatened Florida scrub jay, the wood duck, yellow-bellied sapsucker, wild turkey, black bear, various species of squirrel, and the white-tailed deer"
Quercus virginiana," The tree crown is very dense, making it valuable for shade, and the species provides nest sites for many mammal species"
Quercus virginiana," Native Americans extracted a cooking oil from the acorns, used all parts of live oak for medicinal purposes, leaves for making rugs, and bark for dyes"
Quercus virginiana,"  The roots of seedlings sometimes form starchy, edible tubers"
Quercus virginiana,  People in past centuries harvested and fried these tubers for human consumption much as one might use a potato
Quercus virginiana,"


== Cultivation ==
Southern live oak is cultivated in warmer climates as a specimen tree or for shade in the southern United States (zone 8 and south), Nuevo León and Tamaulipas states in Mexico, and in the warmer parts of the United States, Europe, and Australia"
Quercus virginiana," Cultivation is relatively simple, as Southern live oak seedlings grow fast with ample soil moisture"
